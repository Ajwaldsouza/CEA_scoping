J	Yoon, HI; Kim, J; Son, JE				Yoon, Hyo In; Kim, Jaewoo; Son, Jung Eek			Evaluation of UV-B lighting design for phenolic production in kale plants using optical simulation with three-dimensional plant models in plant factories	BIOSYSTEMS ENGINEERING			English	Article						Antioxidant; Flavonoid; Light interception; Ray -tracing simulation; Secondary metabolite; Vertical farming	RADIATION	Although ultraviolet-B (UV-B, 280-315 nm) radiation has been known as an effective elicitor for improving bioactive compound contents in plants, its practical application to plant factories is still in its infancy. This study aimed to develop an evaluation method for optimising the lighting design of UV-B radiation in plant factories. To this end, a prediction model of phenolic content was adapted for kale (Brassica oleracea L. var. acephala) plants grown in a plant factory using an optical simulation in a three-dimensional plant model. The prediction model was calibrated using experimental data with different 310 nm UV-B light-emitting diode (LED) arrangements. UV-B radiation significantly enhanced the total phenolic content, total flavonoid content, UV-B absorbing pigment content, and antioxidant capacity in kale plants. In scenario analysis with variables of lighting system, such as vertical or horizontal lighting distance and lighting angle of UV-B LED, the spatial distribution of phenolic accumulation was estimated using the calibrated model and simulated UV-B radiation interception. Although the uniformity and efficiency were opposite in most scenarios, both values for phenolic production increased with changes in horizontal position. The annual yields per electrical energy consumed for producing total phenolics and flavonoids were expected to improve by 14.2 and 34.0%, respectively, assuming the addition of UV-B LED as the optimal lighting design among the scenarios. These evaluation and optimisation methods using model-based simulations will help to design custom UV-B lighting systems for the production of bioactive compounds in commercial plant factories.

This study assesses the energy use, economic, and environmental impacts of two different healing and acclimatization systems, the conventional tunnel systems (CTS) and the LED-equipped vertical systems (LVS), for grafted watermelon seedlings in Iran. Life cycle assessment (LCA), cumulative exergy demand (CExD), and life cycle cost analysis (LCCA) approaches are used to assess the impacts of grafted watermelon seedlings. The functional unit is one million grafted watermelon seedlings (MGWS). The top findings of this study indicate that CTS increases energy consumption, damage to human health, ecosystems, and resources compared with the LVS. Further, the economic analysis revealed that the net profit in the multi-floored LVS is 24% higher than that of the CTS. In conclusion, LVS is less energy consumptive and environmentally burdensome yet more profitable than the CTS. Notably, the finding from this study supports recommendations that will be useful for industries or producers who need to develop sustainable grafted watermelon or vegetable production systems in Iran or similar regions. Top recommendations include using organic fertilizers, multi-floor LVS, and most importantly, replacing CTS with LVS to promote a sustainable agricultural production system.

The aim of the present study was to determine the flowering, growth, and yield responses of saffron grown using nutrient solutions with different electrical conductivity (EC) levels (0.7, 1.4, and 2.1 dS m(-1)). Sprouted saffron corms were cultured for 24 weeks under a volcanic rock-based aerated continuous immersion system. Vegetative growth and leaf gas exchange, but not flowering, were affected significantly by EC levels. The optimal EC in a balanced nutrient solution was 0.7 dS m(-1), at which level the highest plant height, leaf area, biomass, photosynthetic rate, number of daughter corms, and percentage of corms >= 25 mm were recorded. An EC level of 2.1 dS m(-1) decreased the photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, and transpiration rate of saffron but increased biochemical stress marker levels and elevated various antioxidant defense enzyme levels significantly in saffron leaves, possibly reflecting a defense response to the cellular damage provoked by the higher EC level. In terms of nutrient solution EC, 0.7 dS m(-1) was optimal in saffron, whereas 2.1 dS m(-1) caused oxidative stress that led to reduced growth and daughter corm production.

Stratified seeds of Panax ginseng 'Chunpoong' were sown. The seedlings were cultivated for 20 weeks using warm-white LEDs with DLI from 1.44 to 10.94 mol m(-2) d(-1), which are combinations of three light intensities (50, 120, and 190 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) and three photoperiods (8, 12, and 16 h d(-1)) in a plant factory with artificial lighting (PFAL). As the DLI increased, the shoot length and leaf area were exponentially reduced after shoot development at both nine and 20 weeks of treatments. At nine weeks of treatment, the greater light intensity and longer photoperiod treatments, where the shoot established fastest, the photosynthetic products were translocated to the roots first and the dry weight distribution in the root increased as DLI increased. In the high light intensity and long photoperiod treatments, SPAD value, maximum (F-v/F-m), and minimum (F-v/F-o) quantum efficiency tended to decrease, and the photosynthetic traits were negatively affected over time with leaf senescence. The root growth rate in high light intensity with long photoperiod treatments seemed to lag behind that in low light intensity with short photoperiod treatments. As a result, this study found that a light intensity of 50 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) with a 12 h d(-1) photoperiod (DLI of 2.16 mol m(-2) d(-1)) was a suitable light environment for both shoot and root growth of ginseng seedlings. Further, the shoot establishment should be considered to design a light environment for ginseng seedling production in a PFAL.

However, this adaptive mechanism improves water use efficiency, and water stress tolerance is still poorly known. This study examined the effect of individual and mixture of NaCl and CaCl2 concentrations on morphological parameters and bioactive component contents of ice plants in a plant factory system. Eight salt treatments individually and a combination of sodium chloride (NaCl) and calcium chloride (CaCl2), and Hoagland solutions were applied after the transplanting of ice plants. Morphological parameters like the number of leaves and lateral stems, leaf chlorophyll content (SPAD value), fresh weight, and dry weight of shoots and roots were measured at the adult stage. Concurrently, in the juvenile phase, the area of a canopy was evaluated using an image processing technique in HSV (hue, saturation, value) colour space. Correspondingly, ice plant secondary metabolites such as cations, anions, and radical scavenging activity were assayed in the adult phase correlated to the salt stress. The effects of salt stress on the growth of ice plants and secondary metabolite production were analysed using completely randomized block designs through the variance by one-way ANOVA with a significance level of p < 0.05. This study demonstrated that 400 mM CaCl2 (T-4) enhanced the biomass and high sodium (Na+) and calcium (Ca2+) accumulations, and 200 mM CaCl2 (T-3) accelerated the potassium (K+), magnesium (Mg2+), phosphate (PO43-), and sulfate (SO42-) accumulations. Moreover, NaCl 400 mM (T-1) and combination of 100 mM NaCl and 300 mM CaCl2 (T-5) positively influenced the chloride (Cl-) deposition and combination of 200 mM NaCl and 200 mM CaCl2 (T-6) improved nitrate (NO3-) accretion. Furthermore, 100 mM CaCl2 (T-2) exhibited the highest antioxidant activity in ice plants grown under the plant factory system. (C) 2022 The Author(s).

While indoor cultivation allows manipulation of artificial lighting to mimic optimal conditions, it introduces an additional energy cost. The study objectives were to assess photoperiod manipulation as a lighting strategy to increase overall biomass and metabolite yields as well as to improve the efficacy of the electrical energy used for indoor cultivation of Stevia rebaudiana in non-native environmental conditions. Stevia was grown under artificial lighting with red, green, and blue wavelengths with photoperiods of 8 h, 12 h, 16 h, and intermittent light amounting to 16/24 h, each with a constant Daily Light Integral (DLI) of 7.2 mol M-2 day(-1). Yield was measured as leaf dry weight biomass in combination with Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LCMS) analysis of Stevioside and Rebaudioside A content. The photon flux density of the artificial and natural light as measured by a spectroradiometer, and the energy use data collected with a three-phase power quality logger, were compared for each treatment tested and to that from plants grown under natural light irradiation in a greenhouse. Yield and energy data were used to determine the efficacies of the lighting systems tested. Stevia plants under a continuous 16-h photoperiod (16H) had the highest productivity, resulting in the highest biomass accumulation and metabolite concentrations. The Stevioside and Rebaudioside A yields per plant were 975% higher than those obtained under natural daylight and day-neutral tropical photoperiod. Overall energy use and photon conversion efficacies were also highest under 16H at 65.10 g kWh(-1) for biomass accumulation, 12.40 g kWh(-1) for metabolite yields and 7.5 mg mol(-1) for photon conversion. These findings support the application of photoperiod manipulation as a viable approach to increase productivity and improve energy use efficacies for indoor cultivation of Stevia rebaudiana plants under artificial lighting in non-native environments with the 16-h photoperiod under red and blue artificial light supplemented with green spectrum as the best option.

Low Red to Far-red ratio increases resistance to CO2 diffusion and reduces photosynthetic efficiency in low light grown tomato plants	ENVIRONMENTAL AND EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY			English	Article						Far-red; Photosynthesis; Tomato; Mesophyll conductance; Red to far-red ratio; Shade, avoidance response; LMA; Photosynthetically active radiation; Photosynthetic, efficiency	CARBON-ISOTOPE DISCRIMINATION; LEAF DRY MASS; MESOPHYLL CONDUCTANCE; SHADE AVOIDANCE; QUANTUM YIELD; GAS-EXCHANGE; IRRADIANCE; LEAVES; AREA; C-4	Application of light-emitting diode technology has opened opportunities to optimize light spectrum for crop production greenhouses and vertical farms. In addition to photosynthetically active radiation, far-red (FR) light has shown potential for enhancing leaf photosynthesis. However, additional FR also alters the red to far-red ratio (R:FR) and induces a shade-avoidance response (SAR) that changes leaf nitrogen, thickness and mass. These acclimations can potentially also alter the resistance to CO2 diffusion, which can limit photosynthesis. Tomato plants were grown with and without additional FR at two light levels. Changes in photosynthetic responses to light and CO2 diffusion resistance, as well as leaf mass, thickness and nitrogen content were assessed. At low light additional FR strongly reduced leaf maximum photosynthesis, leaf mass, thickness and nitrogen, and increased the resistance to CO2 diffusion. These effects were to a much lesser extent present in plants grown at high light intensity. Tomato leaves grown under low light intensity supplemented with FR, show much stronger SAR and a larger increase in CO2 diffusion resistance than plants grown under high light, which negatively influences their photosynthesis at increasing light intensity. Only if the negative effects of sensitivity to FR and SAR response can be avoided, supplemental FR light may be beneficial to enhance photosynthesis in greenhouse and vertical farm systems.

Britton) Cultivated in a Plant Factory with Artificial Light	HORTICULTURAE			English	Article						anthocyanin; antioxidant capacity; flavonoid; gene expression; phenylpropanoid; rosmarinic acid	ANTIOXIDANT CAPACITY; PHENOLIC-COMPOUNDS; PRODUCTION SYSTEM; GENE-EXPRESSION; GROWTH; VEGETABLES	In this study, we investigated the effect of UV-B irradiation 3 days prior to harvest, on the accumulation of rosmarinic acid (RA) and anthocyanin, and the expression of genes related to phenylpropanoid and flavonoid biosynthetic pathways, in red perilla (Perilla frutescens L.). In experiment 1, seedlings at 60 days after sowing (DAS) were subjected to UV-B irradiation at 0 (control), 6, and 10 W m(-2) under a 16 h light period; while in experiment 2, seedlings at 45 DAS were subjected to UV-B irradiation at 0 (control), 4 W m(-2) at continuous irradiation, and 6 W m(-2) at 16 h irradiation. UV irradiation of 10 W m(-2) for 16 h negatively affected leaf color, while irradiation at 6 W m(-2) enhanced RA biosynthesis and antioxidant capacity. Continuous UV-B irradiation of 4 W m(-2) increased the RA concentration by 92% compared to the control; however, this effect was smaller than that of UV-B irradiation at 6 W m(-2) for 16 h, 141% higher than that of the control and had a lower antioxidant capacity against UV-mediated ROS overproduction during the dark period. Results demonstrate that 6 W m(-2) of UV-B irradiation for 16 h is suitable for enhancing the RA concentration and content of red perilla.

Cultured in Plant Factory	JOURNAL OF PLANT GROWTH REGULATION			English	Article; Early Access						LEDs light quality; Growth and development; Yield; Quality; Winter wheat	BLUE-LIGHT; OXIDATIVE STRESS; GREEN-LIGHT; RED-LIGHT; LIPID-PEROXIDATION; STEM ELONGATION; LEAF SENESCENCE; PROTEIN-CONTENT; FLOWERING TIME; GRAIN-YIELD	The light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are expected to be effective light sources for growing wheat in indoor cultivation due to their small size, long lifespan, high safety performance, and customized wavelengths. In the present study, the influences of LEDs light sources with different spectra combinations were investigated in wheat plants grown in hydroponic system. Eight types of different spectra were compared: white light (W), white-green light (W:G = 4:1, W4G1), red-green light (R:G = 4:1, R4G1), red-green-blue light (R:G:B = 4:1:1, R4G1B1), and four types of red-blue lights (R:B = 3:1, R3B1; R:B = 2:1, R2B1; R:B = 1:1, R1B1; R:B = 1:6, R1B6). The growth and development were monitored together with the activity of antioxidant enzymes in leaves. In addition, grain yield and quality were also investigated. The results showed that winter wheat could complete its life cycle under all eight LEDs light regimens in the completely enclosed hydroponic cultivation environment. Among them, plants in W, W4G1, and R4G1 grew fastest, followed by those of R4G1B1 and then by those of R3B1, R2B1, R1B1, and R1B6. Although blue light increased tillering number and dry matter production of whole plant, it was not conducive to distribution of dry matter to spikes and grain yield per plant. On the contrary, red light was positively correlated with dry matter distribution and accumulation in spikes. In addition, green light was helpful for the percentage of earbearing tiller, which constituted the number of spikes. Wheat grown in R4G1 had the higher spike number per plant, grain number per spike, and grain weight, leading to the highest grain yield per plant and harvest index. Meanwhile, the starch content, protein content, as well as the nutritional quality and processing quality of wheat flour grown under R4G1 could reach moderate levels. Taken together, appropriate LED's light spectra, such as R4G1, are efficient for wheat cultivation in a controlled environment and make it possible to achieve faster, more, and better winter wheat production.

J	Cammarisano, L; Korner, O				Cammarisano, Laura; Koerner, Oliver			Response of Cyanic and Acyanic Lettuce Cultivars to an Increased Proportion of Blue Light	BIOLOGY-BASEL			English	Article						vertical farming; lettuce cultivars; anthocyanin; light spectral quality; stomata	RADIATION-USE EFFICIENCY; RED-LIGHT; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; LEAF; TEMPERATURE; STRESS; GROWTH; INDEX; QUALITIES; TRAITS	Simple Summary Indoor crop cultivation systems such as vertical farms or plant factories necessitate artificial lighting. The composition of light quality (i.e., spectral composition) within these systems plays a key role in crop growth and development. Conflicting results on the effects of the light spectrum reported for different plant species and cultivars confirm the specificity of light requirements and the dependency on interacting factors. In this paper, we have therefore investigated how a certain light quality (light with a high share of blue) affects photosynthetic and morphological parameters in two contrasting lettuce cultivars (red and green leaves) with a similar leaf shape and phenotype. The results obtained suggest the occurrence of distinctive morpho-physiological adaptive strategies in green and red pigmented lettuce cultivars to adapt to the higher proportion of blue light environment. Indoor crop cultivation systems such as vertical farms or plant factories necessitate artificial lighting. Light spectral quality can affect plant growth and metabolism and, consequently, the amount of biomass produced and the value of the produce. Conflicting results on the effects of the light spectrum in different plant species and cultivars make it critical to implement a singular lighting solution. In this study we investigated the response of cyanic and acyanic lettuce cultivars to an increased proportion of blue light. For that, we selected a green and a red leaf lettuce cultivar (i.e., 'Aquino', CVg, and 'Barlach', CVr, respectively). The response of both cultivars to long-term blue-enriched light application compared to a white spectrum was analyzed. Plants were grown for 30 days in a growth chamber with optimal environmental conditions (temperature: 20 degrees C, relative humidity: 60%, ambient CO2, photon flux density (PFD) of 260 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) over an 18 h photoperiod). At 15 days after sowing (DAS), white spectrum LEDs (WW) were compared to blue-enriched light (WB; lambda(Peak) = 423 nm) maintaining the same PFD of 260 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). At 30 DAS, both lettuce cultivars adapted to the blue light variant, though the adaptive response was specific to the variety. The rosette weight, light use efficiency, and maximum operating efficiency of PSII photochemistry in the light, F-v/F-m', were comparable between the two light treatments. A significant light quality effect was detected on stomatal density and conductance (20% and 17% increase under WB, respectively, in CVg) and on the modified anthocyanin reflectance index (mARI) (40% increase under WB, in CVr). Net photosynthesis response was generally stronger in CVg compared to CVr; e.g., net photosynthetic rate, P-n, at 1000 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) PPFD increased from WW to WB by 23% in CVg, compared to 18% in CVr. The results obtained suggest the occurrence of distinct physiological adaptive strategies in green and red pigmented lettuce cultivars to adapt to the higher proportion of blue light environment.

In this study, three Light Emitting Diode (LED) lighting systems, with blue (B, 460 nm), red (R, 650 nm) and mixed red + green-yellow + blue (RGB) light were used to grow parsley microgreens to understand how light quality could change the phenotype and the profile of secondary metabolites. Plants showed altered morphological characteristics and higher amounts of secondary metabolites under RGB LEDs treatment. The results demonstrated that microgreens under red light showed the highest fresh yield, petiole length, coumaric acid content but also the highest nitrate content. Plants under RGB light showed the highest dry matter percentage and highest content of total and single polyphenols content, while blue light showed the highest ascorbic acid and ABTS antioxidant activity. Moreover, microgreens under red light showed more compact leaves with less intercellular spaces, while under blue and RGB light, the leaves displayed ticker spongy mesophyll with higher percentage of intercellular spaces. Therefore, the specific spectral band was able to modify not only the metabolic profile, but also it could modulate the differentiation of mesophyll cells. Light quality as a preharvest factor helps to shape the final parsley microgreens product as a whole, not only in terms of yield and quality, but also from a morpho-anatomical point of view.

There was no significant difference in the total fatty acid (FA) contents. Particularly, the major FAs of PGSs were palmitic acid (207.4 mg/100 g) of saturated FAs and linoleic acid (397.6 mg/100 g) and alpha-linolenic acid (222.6 mg/100 g) of unsaturated FAs in the SSC system. The values of total amino acids were all higher in SSC than in DWC. In the case of ginsenosides, the total protopanaxtriol product was 30.88 mg/g in SSC, while the total protopanaxdiol product was 34.83 mg/g in DWC. In particular, the values of total phenolic acids and total flavonols were 133.36 and 388.19 ug/g, respectively, and SSC had a higher content than DWC. In conclusion, the SSC system was shown to be higher in nutritional constituents and antioxidant activities in soil cultivation, suggesting that PGS with SSC has a positive effect on the quality of PGS in a plant factory.

The effects of different UVA (380 +/- 10 nm, 40 mu mol/m(2)/s) exposure durations, including 0 h/d (UV0), 6 h/d (UV6) and 12 h/d (UV12), on the growth and phytochemicals of Chinese kale (Brassica alboglabra) under white 250 mu mol/m(2)/s LEDs were investigated. UVA exposure of different durations influenced the growth and phytochemicals biosynthesis of Chinese kale. Prolonging UVA irradiation throughout the growth cycle positively affected the growth and the development of Chinese kale, with evident increases in the dry weights of shoots and roots, plant height, stem diameter, specific leaf weight and flower budding rate. The application of UVA increased the soluble sugar content, whereas higher flavonoid content and antioxidant capacity (FRAP) and lower nitrate content were only observed in Chinese kale exposed to UV6 treatment. Besides, the qPCR assay showed that supplemental UVA-radiation exposure up-regulated the gene expressions of UVR8, transcription factors genes and genes related to the glucosinolate biosynthesis pathway, thereby promoting the accumulation of glucosinolates. Therefore, supplemental UVA-radiation exposure for 12 h/d was more conducive to plant growth, while supplemental UVA-radiation exposure for 6 h/d was better for phytochemical biosynthesis in Chinese kale in an artificial-light plant factory.

Var. Acephala) and Rocket (Eruca sativa Mill.) Grown in a Vertical Farm	HORTICULTURAE			English	Article						baby leaves; hydroponics; lettuce; nitrate; rocket	LEAFY VEGETABLES; NUTRITIONAL QUALITY; CAROTENOIDS; TOXICITY; YIELD	Hydroponics is the most widely used technique in closed cultivation environments, and this system is often used for the cultivation of baby leaf vegetables. These species can accumulate high levels of nitrates; for this reason, the control of growing conditions is a crucial factor for limiting their content, especially in protected cultivations. The aim of this work was to reduce nitrate accumulation in leafy vegetables grown in a vertical farm while preserving the quality at harvest as well as during storage. This objective was achieved by completely replacing the nutrient solution with water a few hours before harvest ("flushing"). The trials were carried out on lettuce (Lactuca sativa L. Var. Acephala, cv. Greenet) and rocket (Eruca sativa Mill., cv. Rome). Three independent trials were conducted on lettuce, applying the flushing treatment 24 h and 48 h prior to harvest. One trial was conducted on rocket, applying the treatment 48 h before harvesting. Sampling and related analyses were carried out at harvest and during the storage period to determine chlorophyll, leaf fluorescence, total sugars, chlorophyll (a + b), carotenoids, phenolic index, anthocyanins and nitrate content. Moreover, relative humidity (RH%), O-2% and CO2% determination inside the package headspace were monitored during storage. The results obtained indicate that it is possible to reduce the nitrate concentration by up to 56% in lettuce and 61% in rocket while maintaining the product quality of baby leaves by replacing the nutrient solution with tap water before harvest.

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of UV-B dose and wavelength region (280-300 and 300-320 nm) on the morphological, physiological, and biochemical responses of canola plants (Brassica napus L.). Canola plants (17 days after sowing) were subjected to various UV-B intensities (i.e., 0.3, 0.6, and 0.9 W m(-2)) and were divided into cut and non-cut treatments for each UV treatment. Plant growth parameters exhibited different trends based on the treated UV irradiation intensity. Plant growth gradually decreased as the UV irradiation intensity and exposure time increased. Despite the same UV irradiation intensity, plant response varied significantly depending on the presence or absence of a short-wavelength cut filter (<300 nm). Canola plants suffered more leaf damage in nonfilter treatments containing shorter wavelengths (280-300 nm). UV treatment effectively activates the expression of secondary metabolite biosynthetic genes, differing depending on the UV irradiation intensity. Our results suggest that both UV irradiation intensity and wavelength should be considered when enhancing antioxidant phytochemicals without inhibiting plant growth in a plant factory with artificial light.

It contains plenty of sugars, inorganic ions and a variety of secondary metabolites known to improve human health. The aim of this work was to investigate the effect of light spectra on red beets and their components in a vertical farm (VF) compared to open field (OF). RED (red:blue-white = 4:1)-treated shoots elevated total phenolic contents (TPC) among lights. Sugar content in VF red beets was 4.2 times higher than beets from OF. Betalains in VF red beets were 2.4-2.8 times higher than OF ones, and RED-treated roots had significantly higher betalain levels compared to CON (red:blue-white = 2:1)-treated ones. VF red beets contained a higher level of inorganic nitrates and lower chloride compared to OF beets. In conclusion, the light spectrum alters the concentration of beet components to be higher than that of OF red beets, and RED light elevated TPC, sugars and betalains.

This study was conducted to improve the growth, nutrient absorption efficiency, and nutrient use efficiency of basil plants grown in a plant factory with artificial lighting by controlling the nutrient solution management method and light spectrum. Basil plants were treated with 4 applied nutrient quantities and three red:blue ratios from transplanting to harvest (20 days). Results showed that low applied nutrient quantity significantly improved the nutrient use efficiency and nutrient absorption efficiency. Furthermore, the yield of the basil plant and the absorption of N and K were significantly influenced by different red:blue ratios under low applied nutrient quantity treatments. Therefore, this study has determined the optimal combination of the applied nutrient quantity and red:blue ratio for improving the growth, nutrient use efficiency, and nutrient absorption efficiency of basil plants. The findings of this study can be applied to hydroponic basil production for saving resources and protecting the environment. Quantitative nutrient management has advantages, such as saving resources and improving nutrient utilization, compared with the conventional electrical conductivity management method. The growth and nutrient utilization of vegetables are affected by the integrated environmental conditions such as nutrient supply and light spectrum. This study investigated the effects of applied nutrient quantity (ANQ) (0.5, 1, 2, and 4 times (T) the absorption quantity of nutrients determined in the preliminary experiment, indicated by 0.5T, 1T, 2T, and 4T, respectively) in nutrient solution and red:blue ratio (R:B = 3:7, 7:3, and 9:1, indicated by RB3:7, RB7:3, and RB9:1, respectively) on the growth and nutrient utilization of basil plants in a plant factory with artificial lighting. Results demonstrated that the nutrient use efficiency (NUE) and the nutrient absorption efficiency (NAE) were significantly increased by the ANQ of 0.5T compared with the treatments of 1T, 2T, and 4T, irrespective of R:B ratios. Furthermore, under the ANQ of 0.5T, RB7:3 significantly increased the yield and the absorption of N and K of the basil plant compared with other R:B ratios. Therefore, the ANQ of 0.5T combined with RB7:3 was considered the optimal combination to improve the yield, NUE, and NAE of basil plants in the present study.

Currently very limited information is available on the response of ice plant to photoperiod and to daily light integral (DLI). The objective of this study was to determine the impact of photoperiod/DLI on the growth of ice plant for indoor vertical production. Four-week old seedlings of ice plant were transplanted into vertical hydroponic systems and given five photoperiod/DLI treatments: 8/6.3, 12/9.5, 16/12.7, 20/15.8, and 24/19.0 h/mol center dot m(-2)center dot d(-1). Sequential destructive harvests to determine plant growth occurred 14, 21, and 28 days after lighting treatments began. Plants performed better with increasing photoperiod/DLI from 8 h/6.3 mol center dot m(-2)center dot d(-1) to 20 h/15.8 mol center dot m(-2)center dot d(-1). By day 28, shoot fresh weight increased from 160 g to 639 g as the photoperiod/DLI increased from 8 h/6.3 mol center dot m(-2)center dot d(-1) to 20 h/15.8 mol center dot m(-2)center dot d(-1). The continuous lighting treatment, 24 h/19 mol center dot m(-2)center dot d(-1), showed a negative effect on the plant fresh weight (FW) and dry weight (DW). Light treatment did not have obvious effects on shoot:root ratio and macronutrient uptake except that potassium (K) uptake decreased slightly with increased photoperiod/DLI. Plants receiving higher photoperiod/DLI showed the same number of leaves (indicating the same development stage) but had smaller, thicker, and darker green leaves compared to lower photoperiod/DLI treatments. Leaf water content was not affected by light treatment up to 20 h/15.8 mol center dot m(-2)center dot d(-1) but decreased at 24 h/19 mol center dot m(-2)center dot d(-1). Further research is needed to separate the physiological response of increasing/continuous photoperiod from the response of increasing DLI.

Light use efficiency of lettuce cultivation in vertical farms compared with greenhouse and field	FOOD AND ENERGY SECURITY			English	Article; Early Access						indoor farming; light use efficiency; plant factory; potential production; vertical farming	PHOTOSYNTHETIC EFFICIENCY; GROWTH; INTENSITY; RADIATION; WHEAT; YIELD	Vertical farming is a relatively new fresh fruit and vegetable production system, where lamps (mostly light emitting diodes [LED]) are the sole light source. A high light use efficiency (LUEinc), defined as shoot dry weight per incident photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD; g mol(-1)) integral, is crucial for the economic viability of vertical farming. Very different values for LUEinc have been reported in the literature and it is not clear whether LUEinc is higher in vertical farming than in greenhouse or open field cultivation. Values of LUEinc of lettuce grown in a vertical farm (53 studies), greenhouse (13 studies) and open field (8 studies) were collected from literature, as well as relevant cultivation aspects such as lettuce weight at harvest, cultivation period (plant age at harvest), daily light integral, cumulative daily light integral for the whole cultivation period, planting density and CO2 concentration. The average LUEinc for lettuce grown in a vertical farm was 0.55 g mol(-1) which was higher than 0.39 g mol(-1) for greenhouse-grown lettuce. Both were substantially higher than for field-grown lettuce (0.23 g mol(-1)). The maximum measured LUEinc for lettuce grown in a vertical farm (1.63 g mol(-1)) is close to the published maximum theoretical value, which ranges from 1.26 to 1.81 g mol(-1). Since all environmental factors can be fully controlled, vertical farming has the capability to achieve the theoretical maximum LUEinc. Using the highest reported LUEinc based on shoot fresh weight (44 g mol(-1) at 200 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) PPFD and 16 h photoperiod), it is estimated that each layer of a vertical farm can potentially produce annually up to 700 kg of lettuce per m(2) at 500 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) of continuous light.

Br.) is a highly nutritious leafy crop with a rich health-related phytonutrient profile including secondary plant metabolites such as glucosinolates. This semi-aquatic crop is well-suited for indoor hydroponic cultivation and has a growing market for its distinctive peppery taste and health benefits. We describe crop trials in three contrasting environments and report the changes to plant morphology, yield, and nutritional profile under varying blue light treatments. Yield and glucosinolate quantity were significantly increased in a vertical farm system enriched in blue light, relative to field-grown crops. Additionally, PBITC, a glucosinolate not previously identified in field-grown watercress, was found in plants grown in a vertical farm. This work demonstrates the great potential of watercress in a new era of controlled environment agriculture to deliver improved health benefits to customers.

In addition to photosynthesis, the light effects on morphology, flowering, and metabolism are also crucial as plant responses. Light period and quality have been studied for a long time in relation to the flowering of cut-flowers, strawberries, and many leafy vegetables. Light quality, such as red, far-red, and blue, should be considered with their photoreceptors containing phytochrome, cryptochrome, and flavin-binding kelch repeat, F-box 1. Light quality may also affect plant morphogenesis and the accumulation of valuable metabolites, and plant growth regulators (PGRs) are understandably related to them. However, the effects of PGRs, light quality, and photoreceptors on morphogenesis and metabolite accumulation have been only reported individually and have not been comprehensively discussed. In this review, the information on tomatoes, which are important both industrially and academically, was mainly summarized and discussed. Effects of light quality on plant growth, fruit ripening and metabolite accumulation, and biotic and abiotic stresses, as well as the involvement of gibberellin, auxin, ethylene, abscisic acid, jasmonic acid, and salicylic acid, are discussed here with the roles of the photoreceptors of each light quality and light signal integrators. There is no safety problem for light quality use with appropriate wavelength and intensity, and it is environmentally friendly to use light emitting diodes as an energy-saving light source. Therefore, once their effect is clear with scientific evidence in relation to PGRs, light quality control technology can be used and contribute to the improvement of production and quality of tomatoes with the usage of PGRs.

However, unpredictable yield is an obstacle to the application of UV-B radiation to controlled environments such as plant factories. A typical three-dimensional (3D) plant structure causes uneven UV-B exposure with leaf position and age-dependent sensitivity to UV-B radiation. The purpose of this study was to develop a model for predicting phenolic accumulation in kale (Brassica oleracea L. var. acephala) according to UV-B radiation interception and growth stage. The plants grown under a plant factory module were exposed to UV-B radiation from UV-B light-emitting diodes with a peak at 310 nm for 6 or 12 h at 23, 30, and 38 days after transplanting. The spatial distribution of UV-B radiation interception in the plants was quantified using ray-tracing simulation with a 3D-scanned plant model. Total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), total anthocyanin content (TAC), UV-B absorbing pigment content (UAPC), and the antioxidant capacity were significantly higher in UV-B-exposed leaves. Daily UV-B energy absorbed by leaves and developmental age was used to develop stepwise multiple linear regression models for the TPC, TFC, TAC, and UAPC at each growth stage. The newly developed models accurately predicted the TPC, TFC, TAC, and UAPC in individual leaves with R-2 > 0.78 and normalized root mean squared errors of approximately 30% in test data, across the three growth stages. The UV-B energy yields for TPC, TFC, and TAC were the highest in the intermediate leaves, while those for UAPC were the highest in young leaves at the last stage. To the best of our knowledge, this study proposed the first statistical models for estimating UV-B-induced phenolic contents in plant structure. These results provided the fundamental data and models required for the optimization process. This approach can save the experimental time and cost required to optimize the control of UV-B radiation.

Supplemental UV-A treatments (T1: 6 mu mol center dot m(-2) s(-1), T2: 12 mu mol center dot m(-2) s(-1) and T3: 18 mu mol center dot m(-2) s(-1)) resulted in higher moisture content, higher pigment content, and greater leaf area of kale while T2 reached its highest point. T2 treatment positively enhanced the antioxidant capacity, increased the contents of soluble protein, soluble sugar and reduced the nitrate content. T1 treatment markedly increased the content of aliphatic glucosinolate (GSL), whereas T2 treatment highly increased the contents of indolic GSL and total GSL. Genes related to GSL biosynthesis were down-regulated in CK and T3 treatments, while a majority of them were greatly up-regulated by T1 and T2. Hence, supplemental 12 mu mol center dot m(-2) s(-1) UV-A might be a promising strategy to enhance the growth and quality of kale in a plant factory.

However, for fruit bearing crops such as strawberry, a major challenge is optimizing light spectral composition to control flowering. We have shown that it is possible to stimulate flowering and fruit development with different light treatments in the day-neutral strawberry accessions Fragaria vesca 'Yellow Wonder' YW5AF7 and 'Hawaii-4'. We used blue (449 nm) and far-red (740 nm) light in a background of sunlight-mimicking photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) under both long-and short-day photoperiods. Flower induction was most successful when blue light was given during the night and far-red light was given for 24 h. These light treatments overruled the photoperiodic control of flowering. Both light treatments boosted flowering, leading to a higher fruit yield, with minor effects on vegetative plant growth. We also evaluated the role of FvCO and FvFT1 using expression analysis and RNAi lines, and revealed that both blue and far-red light treatments trigger flowering in part through the conserved FvCO and FvFT1 cascade. Blue light operates through FvFT1, partially independently of FvCO, while far-red light operates independently of FvCO. Furthermore, using transcriptional reporter lines of FvFT1, we found that FvFT1 is ontogenetically and tissue-specifically regulated, being exclusively expressed in the veins of older leaves, and induced predominantly by blue and far-red light.

However, to realize VF's potential as a sustainable food source, innovative technologies are required to ensure that VF can be industrialized on a massive scale and extended beyond leafy greens and fruits into the production of food staples or row crops. While technological advances have improved the energy efficiency of VF lighting systems, there has been insufficient research into biostimulation as an approach to reduce energy needs and improve crop quality and yield. We conducted a controlled trial to investigate the application of a phycocyanin-rich Spirulina extract (PRSE) as a biostimulant in hydroponically grown, vertically farmed lettuce (Salanova (R) Lactuca sativa and Salanova (R) Red Crisp). Phenotype analysis for Salanova (R) Red Crisp with PRSE application showed a reduced time from seed to harvest by 6 days, increased yield by 12.5%, and improved antioxidant flavonoid levels. Metagenomic analysis of the microbial community of the nutrient solution for Salanova (R) Lactuca sativa cultivation indicated a 62% reduction in the bacterial population for the PRSE treatment group (vs. 0.017% increase for the control group). An increase in the overall bacterial diversity and evenness was found in the PRSE treatment group as compared to a decrease in these parameters for the control group. This preliminary study reveals the utility of PRSE for plant growth promotion, improvement in crop yield, and potential prebiotic activity in hydroponic vertical farming. Moreover, it demonstrates that microalgae-derived biostimulants may play an important role in improving the economic and environmental sustainability of VF.

By using the depth information and considering the prior adjacent constraint between the fruit and the stem of cherry tomatoes, this paper proposes an improved Mask R-CNN for visual recognition of cherry tomatoes. Firstly, the input layer of the network is modified to achieve dual-mode data fusion of RGB and depth images. Secondly, by constructing the corresponding region generation network to indicate the integral constraint between the fruit and the stem, false recognition of branches is reduced. Thirdly, a multi-class prediction subnetwork is used to decouple the pixel-level category predictions of fruit and stem. Meanwhile, multi-task loss balance and adaptive feature pooling are adopted to overcome the limitation caused by the size difference between fruit and stem. The experimental results show that the improved Mask R-CNN achieved an accuracy of 93.76% for fruit recognition, which is 11.53% and 15.5% higher than that of the standard Mask R-CNN and YOLACT, and it achieves an accuracy of 89.34% for stem recognition, which is 13.91% and 19.7% higher than that of the standard Mask R-CNN and YOLACT, respectively. Besides, the recall rate of the proposed method for stem recognition is 94.47%, which is 11.53% and 8.3% higher than that of YOLACT and Mask R-CNN, respectively. In addition, the proposed method takes only 0.04 s to process a single image, providing an efficient approach for automatically picking cherry tomatoes in plant factories.

According to the planting environment and facility conditions of tomato plants, a computer vision system for fruit counting and yield estimation was designed and the new position loss function was based on the generalized intersection over union (GIoU), which improved the traditional YOLO algorithm loss function. Meanwhile, the scale invariant feature could promote the description precision of the different shapes of fruits. Based on the construction and labeling of the sample image data, the K-means clustering algorithm was used to obtain nine prior boxes of different specifications which were assigned according to the hierarchical level of the feature map. The experimental results of model training and evaluation showed that the mean average precision (mAP) of the improved detection model reached 99.3%, which was 2.7% higher than that of the traditional YOLOv3 model, and the processing time for a single image declined to 15 ms. Moreover, the improved YOLOv3 model had better identification effects for dense and shaded fruits. The research results can provide yield estimation methods and technical support for the research and development of intelligent control system for planting fruits and vegetables in plant factories, greenhouses and fields.

J	Franchetti, B; Pirri, F				Franchetti, Benjamin; Pirri, Fiora			Detection and Localization of Tip-Burn on Large Lettuce Canopies	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE			English	Article						tip-burn detection and localization; self supervised segmentation; plant disease classification; segmentation of large canopies; indoor farming	PLANTS; FIELD	Recent years have seen an increased effort in the detection of plant stresses and diseases using non-invasive sensors and deep learning methods. Nonetheless, no studies have been made on dense plant canopies, due to the difficulty in automatically zooming into each plant, especially in outdoor conditions. Zooming in and zooming out is necessary to focus on the plant stress and to precisely localize the stress within the canopy, for further analysis and intervention. This work concentrates on tip-burn, which is a plant stress affecting lettuce grown in controlled environmental conditions, such as in plant factories. We present a new method for tip-burn stress detection and localization, combining both classification and self-supervised segmentation to detect, localize, and closely segment the stressed regions. Starting with images of a dense canopy collecting about 1,000 plants, the proposed method is able to zoom into the tip-burn region of a single plant, covering less than 1/10th of the plant itself. The method is crucial for solving the manual phenotyping that is required in plant factories. The precise localization of the stress within the plant, of the plant within the tray, and of the tray within the table canopy allows to automatically deliver statistics and causal annotations. We have tested our method on different data sets, which do not provide any ground truth segmentation mask, neither for the leaves nor for the stresses; therefore, the results on the self-supervised segmentation is even more impressive. Results show that the accuracy for both classification and self supervised segmentation is new and efficacious. Finally, the data set used for training test and validation is currently available on demand.

In order to examine the effects of different red and blue light ratios (R:B ratio) on growth, photosynthesis, and absorption spectrum of plant leaves, and to analyze the energy use efficiency, the pakchoi (Brassica Chinensis L. cv. Xiazhijiao) was cultivated hydroponically under white LEDs with R:B ratios of 0.9 (L0.9) and 1.8 (L1.8), white plus red LEDs with R:B ratios of 2.7 (L2.7) and 4.0 (L4.0) for 40 d, respectively. The results showed that the leaf length and width were significantly greater in the L0.9 treatment than in other treatments, and the dry weight per plant increased by over 33% when R:B ratio decreased from 4.0 to 0.9. The net photosynthesis rates of pakchoi leaves ranged from 9.2 to 9.6 ??mol/(m2??s) under different lighting conditions, which had no significant difference. The biggest difference in the spectrum absorptance of pakchoi leaves was expressed in green light waveband, and the highest absorption of plant leaves was under L0.9 and L1.8 treatments. The light energy use efficiency (LUE), photon yield (PY), and energy yield (EY) in L0.9 were over 25% higher than that in the other treatments, while there was no significant difference in the electrical energy use efficiency (EUE). In conclusion, an optimal light quality to cultivate pakchoi in PFALs was the white LEDs with R:B ratio of 0.9, and this finding could provide a promising lighting environment to hydroponic pakchoi yield and energy use efficiency.

Two cultivars of lettuce Lactuca sativa var. longifolium namely 'Casual' (Syngenta)-midi romaine lettuce with medium-compact heads-and 'Elizium' (Enza Zaden)-a mini type (Little Gem) with compact heavy heads-were used. PPFD of 160 and 240 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) and photoperiod of 16 and 20 h were applied, and Daily Light Integral (DLI) values were 9.2, 11.5, 13.8, and 17.3 mol m(-2) day(-1). The experiment lasted 30 days in the Indoor Controlled Environment Agriculture facility. DLI equal to 17.3 mol m(-2) per day for cv. 'Casual' and 11.5-17.3 mol m(-2) per day for cv. 'Elizium' allowed to obtain a very high fresh weight, 350 and 240 g, respectively, within 30 days of cultivation in an indoor plant production facility. The application of the lowest PPFD 160 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) and 16 h photoperiod (9.2 mol m(-2) per day DLI) resulted in the lowest fresh weight, the number of leaves and head circumference. The level of nitrate, even at the lowest DLI, was below the limit imposed by European Community Regulation. The cv. 'Elizium' lettuce grown at PPFD 240 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) and 16 h photoperiod had the highest overall sensory quality. The cv. 'Casual' lettuce grown at PPFD 160 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) and 20 h photoperiod had the lowest sensory quality. The samples subjected to different photoperiod and PPFD were also successively distinguished in an objective and non-destructive way using image features and machine learning algorithms. The average accuracy for the leaf samples of cv. 'Casual' lettuce reached 98.75% and for cv. 'Elizium' cultivar-86.25%. The obtained relationship between DLI and yield, as well as the quality of romaine lettuce, can be used in practice to improve romaine lettuce production in an Indoor Controlled Environment.

When the night length is less than a specified cultivar-dependent critical value, however, it does not develop flowers. This study investigated the effects of low-intensity supplementary or night interrupting (NI) blue (B) light on the plant performance and flower induction in kalanchoe 'Rudak'. During the photoperiod in a closed-type plant factory with day/night temperatures of 23 degrees C/18 degrees C, white (W) LEDs were utilized to produce a photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) of 300 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), and B LEDs were used to give supplementary/NI light at a PPFD of 10 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). The control plants were exposed to a 10-h short day (SD, positive control) or a 13-h long day (LD, negative control) treatment without any B light. The B light was used for 4 h either (1) to supplement the W LEDs at the end of the SD (SD + 4B) and LD (LD + 4B), or (2) to provide night interruption (NI) in the SD (SD + NI-4B) and LD (LD + NI-4B). The LD + 4B and LD + NI-4B significantly enhanced plant growth and development, followed by the SD + 4B and SD + NI-4B treatments. In addition, the photosynthesis, physiological parameters, and activity of antioxidant systems were improved in those treatments. Except in the LD and LD + NI-4B, all plants flowered. It is noteworthy that kalanchoe 'Rudak' flowered in the LD + 4B treatment and induced the greatest number of flowers, followed by SD + NI-4B and SD + 4B. Plants grown in the LD + 4B treatment had the highest expression levels of certain monitored genes related to flowering. The results indicate that a 4-h supplementation of B light during the photoperiod in both the SD and LD treatments increased flower bud formation, promoted flowering, and enhanced plant performance. Kalanchoe 'Rudak' flowered especially well in the LD + 4B, presenting a possibility of practically inducing flowering in long-day seasons with B light application.

However, there are a number of issues relating to low quality of seed germination and seedling vigor that lead to decreased crop yields. The present study investigates the optimal KNO3 concentration for seed germination, and the influence of different light spectra on early plant growth in holy basil (Ocimum tenuiflorum) under a PFAL system. Experiment 1 investigated the effects of KNO3 concentration (0, 0.2, 0.4 and 0.6%) on germination of seeds primed for 24 h under white Light emitting diodes (LED). Results show that sowing holy basil seeds in 0.4% KNO3 enhanced seed germination percentage (GP) and germination index (GI), while decreasing mean germination time (MGT). Experiment 2 investigated the effect of four light spectra on seed germination and early plant growth by sowing with 0 and 0.4% KNO3 and germinating for 15 days continuously under different monochromatic light settings: white, red, green and blue in PFAL. It was found that the green spectrum positively affected shoot and root length, and also decreased shortened MGT at 0 and 0.4% KNO3 when compared with other light treatments. Additionally, pre-cultivated seedlings under the green spectrum showed significant improvement in the early plant growth for all holy basil varieties at 15 days after transplanting by promoting stem length, stem diameter, plant width, fresh weights of shoot and root, and dry weights of shoot and root. These findings could be useful in developing seed priming and light treatments to enhance seed germination and seedling quality of holy basil resulting in increased crop production under PFAL.

The results showed that, all the abnormal L/D cycles increased shoot dry weight (DW) of lettuce (by 34-83%) compared with the control, and lettuce DW increased with the L/D cycle period prolonged. The contents of soluble sugar and crude fiber in lettuce showed an overall upward trend with the length of L/D cycle extended, and the highest vitamin C content as well as low nitrate content were both detected in lettuce treated with L120/D60. The light use efficiency (LUE) and electric use efficiency (EUE) of lettuce reached the maximum (respectively 5.37% and 1.76%) under L120/D60 treatment and so were DW, Assimilation rate (A), RC/CS, ABS/CS, TRo/CS and DIo/CS, indicating that longer L/D cycle period was beneficial for the assimilation efficiency and dry matter accumulation in lettuce leaves. The highest shoot fresh weight (FW) and nitrate content detected in lettuce subjected to L24/D12 may be related to the vigorous growth of root, specific L/D cycle seemed to strengthen root growth and water absorption of lettuce. The openness level of RC in PSII (psi(o)), ETo/CS, and PIabs were all the highest in lettuce treated with L24/D12, implying that slightly extending the L/D cycle period might promote the energy flowing to the final electron transfer chain. In general, irradiation modes with extended L/D cycle period had the potential to improve energy use efficiency and biomass of lettuce in PFAL. No obvious stress or injury was detected in lettuce subjected to prolonged L/D cycles in terms of plant growth and production. From the perspective of shoot FW, the optimal treatment in this study was L24/D12, while L120/D60 was the recommended treatment as regards of the energy use efficiency and nutritional quality.

Lack of Blue Light Regulation of Antioxidants and Chilling Tolerance in Basil	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE			English	Article						blue light; basil; vertical farming; anthocyanins; antioxidants; chilling injury; quality	SYNTHASE GENE-EXPRESSION; ROSMARINIC ACID CONTENT; ANTHOCYANIN ACCUMULATION; PHENOLIC COMPOSITION; SWEET BASIL; RED; QUALITY; STRESS; GROWTH; RATIO	Blue light, measuring from 400 to 500 nm, is generally assumed to increase the content of antioxidants in plants independent of the species. Blue light stimulates the biosynthesis of phenolic compounds such as flavonoids and their subclass anthocyanins from the phenylpropanoid pathway. Flavonoids, anthocyanins, and phenolic acids are strong reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavengers and may lessen the symptoms of abiotic stresses such as chilling. We tested the hypothesis that a high percentage of blue light induces the accumulation of antioxidants and that this effect depends on the photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD, 400-700 nm). The effect may be more pronounced at a lower PPFD. We investigated the changes in primary and secondary metabolites of basil in response to the percentage of blue light (9, 33, 65, and 100%) applied either as a 5-day End-Of-Production (EOP) treatment or continuous throughout the growth cycle in the green cv. Dolly. We also studied if the response to the percentage of blue light (9 or 90%) was dependent on the total PPFD (100 or 300 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) PPFD) when applied as a 5-day EOP treatment in the green cv. Dolly and the purple cv. Rosie. For both green and purple basil, it was found that the percentage of blue light had little effect on the levels of antioxidants (rosmarinic acid, total ascorbic acid, total flavonoids, and total anthocyanins) at harvest and no interactive effect with PPFD was found. Antioxidants generally decreased during postharvest storage, wherein the decrease was more pronounced at 4 than at 12 degrees C. Chilling injury, as judged from a decrease in F-v/F-m values and from the occurrence of black necrotic areas, was not affected by the percentage of blue light. Particularly, chilling tolerance in the purple cultivar was increased in plants grown under higher PPFD. This may be related to the increased levels of soluble sugar and starch in leaves from high PPFD treated plants.	[Larsen, Dorthe H.; Li, Hua; Shrestha, Samikshya; Verdonk, Julian C.; Marcelis, Leo F.

However, evaluations under different environmental conditions are limited. The aim of this study was to characterize the growth and productivity of 20 compact tomato cultivars grown indoors under environmental conditions that resembled a residential space (11 mol.m(-2).d(-1) of white light, constant 22 degrees C, and moderate relative humidity) or in a greenhouse with sunlight only. Plants in the greenhouse were generally larger and yielded more fruit than those grown indoors, likely due to the various differences in environmental conditions and corresponding effects of water and nutrient availability. Considering growth and yield variables, all cultivars evaluated in this study are recommended for outdoor gardening. However, 'Little Bing', 'Sweet Sturdy (TM) F1-Grace', 'Sweet Sturdy (TM) F1-Jimmy', 'Sweet Sturdy (TM) F1-Jo', and 'Tarzan F10 are likely too large to be grown in most space-limited indoor environments. Furthermore, 'Little Bing', 'Rosy Finch', 'Sweet 'n' Neat Yellow', and 'Yellow Canary' were affected by intumescence when grown indoors, which could negatively affect gardening experiences until recommendations to mitigate this disorder become available. Results from this study provide baseline information for the use of compact tomato cultivars for container gardening indoors and under sunlight.

Light quality is regarded as one of the considerable environmental factors affecting plant photomorphogenesis processes and bio-active compounds biosynthesis. There is a great demand for high-quality medicinal plants and plant factory systems would be helpful in response to this demand. But, before using these systems, the light spectrum required for each species must be determined. So, in this study the Hypericum perforatum L. cv. Topas plantlets were subjected to six red (R) to blue (B) light ratio treatments including 100 R:0B, 80 R:20B, 50 R:50B, 20 R:80B, 0 R:100B, and white LED was considered as control. Among the six various light treatments, plants grown under 100% red LED showed the highest fresh and dry weight of flowers, foliage and roots. The total shoot number, flowering shoot number, and flower number were significantly (P < 0.05) affected by red light spectrum, while the blue light LED and especially monochromatic blue light resulted in growth retardation. The blue light spectrum promoted the proline concentration and oxidative stress markers such as H2O2 and MDA, whereas soluble sugars concentration was higher in plants under red LED light. The highest percentage of hypericin (4.42%/m2), pseudohypericin (8.07%/m2), and hyperforin (50.67%/m2) were detected in flowers under red light treatment, calculated based on square meter. Total phytochrome was higher in the leaves of plants under R50: B50 LED and 100 R:0B treatments. Expression of the photoreceptor and flowering-related genes HpPHYA, CRY1, CRY2, GI, CO and FTL, were affected in plants under sole red light. Molecular studies have shown that red light has a flowering-enhancing effect, in contrast, blue light has a deterrent effect on H. perforatum flowering. This corroborates that red light can promote H. perforatum growth and flowering by inducing morphological, physiological and molecular responses.

J	Liu, JY; Liu, WK				Liu, Jiayuan; Liu, Wenke			Regulation of accumulation and metabolism circadian rhythms of starch and sucrose in two leaf-color lettuces by red:blue ratios of LED continuous light	ENVIRONMENTAL AND EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY			English	Article						Lettuce cultivar; Continuous light; Light quality; Circadian rhythm; Carbohydrate accumulation; Enzyme activity	BLUE-LIGHT; GREENHOUSE TOMATO; CARBON METABOLISM; EMITTING-DIODES; NITRATE CONTENT; GROWTH; RED; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; RESPONSES; LEAVES	There are interspecies differences in lettuce CL tolerance to LED red and blue light. It is important to clarify the response mechanism of tolerant and sensitive lettuce to CL to achieve efficient application of CL in artificial light plant factories. In the experiment, red-blue LEDs were used to provide a conventional light (360 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1), red:blue ratio 4:1 and 18/6 h photoperiod) and three continuous light (CL) treatments with various red:blue ratios (270 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1), red:blue ratio 4:1, 2:1 and 1:1) for CL-sensitive and tolerant lettuce cultivars (Yidali and Zishan) with the same daily light integral. The effects of CL quality on the growth, diurnal starch and sucrose accumulation and metabolism of two lettuces were studied by sampling at 6:00, 12:00, 18:00 and 24:00 on the 12 days after light treatment. The results showed that red-blue CL up-regulated shoot biomass of two cultivars, which might be attributed to root and leafy morphology, and chlorophyll content responses. CL with the 80% red light produced the greatest yield, but minor and medium leafy injury was found only on Yidali. CL improved starch and sucrose contents diurnally in two lettuce cultivars, and they totally decreased with blue light proportion. Sucrose synthase (SS), sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS), acid invertase (AI), neutral invertase (NI), adenosine diphosphate glucose pyrophosphorylas (AGP), alpha-amylase and 0-amylase activities under CL were improved in two lettuces compared with the conventional light. Starch and sucrose contents and SS, SPS and AGP activities basically decreased with blue light proportion for two cultivars, while AI, NI, alpha-amylase and 0-amylase activities increased inversely totally. CL irrespectively of its quality disordered the circadian rhythms of carbohydrate accumulation and metabolic enzyme activities in two lettuces. Starch content related closely positively with AGP, alpha-amylase and beta-amylase activities for Zishan, but positively AGP and beta-amylase activities for Yidali. Sucrose content correlated negatively with AI and NI activities for Zishan, while positively SS and SPS activities for Yidali. To sum up, red-blue CL with low-dose blue light could improve Yidali and Zishan lettuce yield, starch and sucrose accumulation, and metabolic enzyme activity, but CL disordered the circadian rhythms of carbohydrate accumulation and metabolic enzyme activity irrespectively of spectral quality. Yidali and Zishan lettuces are sensitive and tolerant cultivars to red-blue CL, which is not up to their abilities to maintain circadian rhythms of carbohydrate accumulation and metabolism. Furthermore, starch accumulation in two cultivars was controlled jointly by synthesis and decomposition enzymes, but sucrose accumulation in Yidali lettuce depended on decomposition enzymes rather than synthesis enzyme for purple lettuce.

To cultivate large quantities of a defined product quality, a standardized production process is needed. A small-scale, re-circulating indoor vertical farm (IVF) with artificial lighting and a nutrient control and dosing system was used for this purpose. The influence of different light intensities (50, 100 and 150 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) and spectral distributions (red/blue ratios: 70/30, 50/50 and 30/70%) on relative growth rate (RGR), crude protein content (CPC), relative protein yield (RPY) and chlorophyll a of the duckweed species Lemna minor and Wolffiella hyalina were investigated. Increasing light intensity increased RGR (by 67% and 76%) and RPY (by 50% and 89%) and decreased chlorophyll a (by 27% and 32%) for L. minor and W. hyalina, respectively. The spectral distributions had no significant impact on any investigated parameter. Wolffiella hyalina achieved higher values in all investigated parameters compared to L. minor. This investigation proved the successful cultivation of duckweed in a small-scale, re-circulating IVF with artificial lighting.

DC) Sprouts in a Plant Factory with Artificial Lighting	HORTICULTURAE			English	Article						balloon flower; plant factory; soil; soilless; temperature	SAPONIN; MACROPHAGES; GROWTH; LEAVES; RADIX; ROOT	The objective of this study was to determine the efficiency of balloon flower sprout's saponin production in a plant factory with artificial lighting (PFAL). Balloon flower has been traditionally used as herbal medicine and now, it is used as a medicinal plant as well as a functional food. It is important to establish the cultivation conditions for the stable production of high-quality balloon flower. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of culture systems and temperature conditions on the growth and saponin accumulation of balloon flower sprouts in controlled environment systems. One-year balloon flower roots were cultivated in soil and soilless culture systems at different temperature conditions (20, 25, and 30 degrees C) for 17 days. The results showed that the shoot fresh weight and shoot dry weight of the balloon flower sprouts grown in the soilless culture system at 25 degrees C were significantly increased by about 1.29 and 1.58 times, respectively, as compared with those of the sprouts grown in a soil culture system. Sprouts grown in the soilless culture system at 25 degrees C also recorded the highest root fresh weight, whereas there was no significant difference in root dry weight among the treatments. The plant height results showed an increased trend similar to that of the shoot fresh weight and shoot dry weight of the balloon flower sprouts. The concentrations of platycodin D3 (Pd-D3), polygalcin D (Pc-D), and total saponin in the shoot parts were highest in the soilless culture system at 20 and 25 degrees C. The root parts of sprouts grown in the soilless culture system at 30 degrees C also had higher deapioplatycodin D (Dpd-D) and total saponin concentrations. Overall, these results suggest that a soilless culture system with temperature conditions at 20 and 25 degrees C is suitable for improving the growth and saponin concentration of balloon flower cultivated in PFALs. Ultimately, our research should be a valuable resource for future research on the production of medicinal plants such as sprouts and should provide basic information to establish methods for enhancing the growth and bioactive compounds in balloon flower.

(2) Methods: We used LEDs (red/green/blue = 8:1:1) as a light source and set the temperature and RH of the plant factory to 20 +/- 2 degrees C and 50% +/- 5%, respectively. We grew lettuce under three air anion conditions-sideward, upward, and downward-and compared the growth characteristics to those of a control grown without air anions. We measured the growth characteristics of the lettuce at 3 and 4 weeks after sowing, and the measurement items were shoot fresh weight (FW) and dry weight (DW); leaf area (LA), length (LL), and width (LW); SPAD; antioxidant capacity; and total phenol content. (3) Results: At 4 weeks, FW in the downward treatment condition was 25.3% higher than in the control, and DW showed a similar difference. LA was about 1943.94 cm(2)/plant in the downward treatment condition, which was about 15.5% higher than in the control. (4) Conclusions: We conclude that air anion generation has a positive effect on lettuce growth, and the optimal generation position for air anions is downward.

Recent advances in the development of plant factories with artificial lighting (PFAL) have led to improved qualitative and/or quantitative production of bioactive compounds in several medicinal plants. However, information concerning the effect of light qualities on plant pharmaceutical properties is limited. The influence of three different light-emitting diode (LED) spectra on leaf fresh weight (FW), bioactive compound production and bioactivity of Artemisia annua L. against the malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum NF54 was investigated. Correlation between the A. annua metabolites and antimalarial activity of light-treated plant extracts were also determined. Results Artemisia annua plants grown under white and blue spectra that intersected at 445 nm exhibited higher leaf FW and increased amounts of artemisinin and artemisinic acid, with enhanced production of several terpenoids displaying a variety of pharmacological activities. Conversely, the red spectrum led to diminished production of bioactive compounds and a distinct metabolite profile compared with other wavelengths. Crude extracts obtained from white and blue spectral treatments exhibited 2 times higher anti-Plasmodium falciparum activity than those subjected to the red treatment. Highest bioactivity was 4 times greater than those obtained from greenhouse-grown plants. Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) revealed a strong correlation between levels of several terpenoids and antimalarial activity, suggesting that these compounds might be involved in increasing antimalarial activity. Conclusions Results demonstrated a strategy to overcome the limitation of A. annua cultivation in Bangkok, Thailand. A specific LED spectrum that operated in a PFAL system promoted the accumulation of some useful phytochemicals in A. annua, leading to increased antimalarial activity. Therefore, the application of PFAL with appropriate light spectra showed promise as an alternative method for industrial production of A. annua or other useful medicinal plants with minimal environmental influence.

Two constant simultaneous rend and bleu (R-B) light treatments including one normal photoperiod (RB, 16/8 h, 225 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1)) and one continuous light (RB', 24/0 h, 150 mu mol.m(-2).;s(-1)) as well as three alternating temporally overlapped light treatments (B to R-B and then R, each part lasts the same time) with alternating frequencies of one time (T1), two times (T2) and four times (T4) respectively in 24 h were set up with the same daily light integral (DLI). The lettuce plants were exposed to the irradiation patterns for 14 days. In all treatments, plants received the same quantum number of red or blue light and the same daily light integral (12.96 mu mol.m(-2)). In comparison with normal photoperiod (RB), the results showed that lettuce plants gained greater shoot fresh and dry weight under RB' and T1 both on the 7 and 14 days after treatment, which depended on leaf area and biomass allocation. Among alternating light treatments, the shoot fresh weight of lettuce decreased with the increase of alternating frequencies. Lettuce plants under alternating temporally overlapped treatments had significantly higher MDA, H2O2 and O(2-)contents as well as higher SOD and CAT activities than that under RB and RB'. Alternating light treatments also induced phenols accumulation, and particularly lettuce under T2 had significantly higher anthocyanin, flavonoid and total phenol contents than RB. However, prolongation of light period under the same DLI condition might promote nitrate accumulation in lettuce while had no positive effects on starch and soluble sugar contents. Therefore, alternating temporally overlapped red and blue light under continuous irradiation could improve the antioxidant capacity of lettuce to a certain extent, and the responses of lettuce antioxidant system to alternating light exposure might depend on the duration and alternating frequency of two monochromatic light qualities.

The results show that lettuce growth and gas exchange are closely related to CO2 concentration and illumination intensity, while air speed enhances CO2 transport during photosynthesis. The most influential two-way interactions were observed between CO2 concentration and illumination intensity on the fresh and dry weights of lettuce shoots with effect sizes of 34% and 32%, respectively, and on the photosynthesis, transpiration and light use efficiency, with effect sizes of 52%, 47% and 41%, respectively. The most significant three-way interaction was observed for the photosynthetic rate, with an effect size of 51%. In general, the fresh and dry weights of lettuce plants increased by 36.2% and 20.1%, respectively, with an increase in CO2 concentration from 500 to 1500 mu mol mol(-1) and by 48.9% and 58.6%, respectively, with an increase in illumination intensity from 100 to 300 mu mol m(-)(2) s(-1). The photosynthetic rate was found to be positively correlated with CO2 concentration, illumination intensity and air speed. The transpiration rate and stomatal conductance increased by 34.9% and 42.1%, respectively, when the illumination intensity increased from 100 to 300 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). However, as CO2 concentration increased from 500 to 1500 mu mol mol(-1) and air speed increased from 0.25 to 0.75 m s(-1), the transpiration rate decreased by 17.5% and 12.8%, respectively. With the quantified data obtained, we were able to adequately determine how CO2 concentration, illumination intensity and air speed interact with their combined effects on the growth of lettuce plants grown in indoor cultivation systems with artificial lighting.

However, the profitability of cultivating ordinary leafy green crops with low market prices in vertical farming is debated. We studied the agronomic feasibility and viability of growing a medicinal plant-Euphorbia peplus-for its ingenol-mebutate content in a modified shipping container farm as an alternative crop cultivation system. The impacts of three hydroponic substrates, three light intensities, three plant localizations and two surface areas on E. peplus yield and cost were tested in several scenarios. The optimization of biomass yield and area surface decreased the cultivation cost, with fresh crop cost per kg ranging from euro185 to euro59. Three ingenol-mebutate extraction methods were tested. The best extraction yields and cheapest method can both be attributed to ethyl acetate at 120 degrees C, with a yield of 43.8 mg/kg at a cost of euro38 per mg. Modeling of the profitability of a pharmaceutical gel based on ingenol-mebutate showed that economic feasibility was difficult to reach, but some factors could rapidly increase the profitability of this production.

The electrical conductivity (EC) of NSs influences the yield and quality of vegetables. The purpose of this study was to optimize the yield and antioxidant accumulation of basil in a PFAL by EC management. In experiment 1, basil plants were grown under four different ECs (0.5, 1.0, 3.0, and 5.0 dS m(-1)) after transplanting. At 18 days after treatment, the highest levels of shoot fresh and dry weights, leaf fresh and dry weights, and leaf area were observed at an EC of 3.0 dS m(-1). However, low-EC treatments (0.5 and 1.0 dS m(-1)) generated total phenolic content (TPC) and antioxidant capacities that were higher than those of other EC treatments (3.0 and 5.0 dS m(-1)). In experiment 2, basil plants were grown at an EC of 3.0 dS m(-1) for 13 or 15 days, then treated with water or NS with low ECs (0.5 and 1.0 dS m(-1)) for 5 or 3 days before harvest. The short-term low-EC treatments, especially, water for 3 days and 0.5 dS m(-1) for 5 days, significantly increased the TPC and antioxidant capacity of leaves without significantly decreasing the yields of basil, compared with the control. In conclusion, yield of basil was optimized with an EC of 3.0 dS m(-1); however, the TPC and antioxidant capacity of basil were significantly increased by low ECs of 0.5 and 1.0 dS m(-1). Short-term low-EC treatments (0.5 dS m(-1) for 5 days or water for 3 days) could be used to promote the TPC and antioxidant capacity in leaves without sacrificing yield of basil significantly.

The Impact of LED Lighting Spectra in a Plant Factory on the Growth, Physiological Traits and Essential Oil Content of Lemon Balm (Melissa officinalis)	PLANTS-BASEL			English	Article						vertical farming; 435 nm; 450 nm; white light; light quality; growth; chemical profile	CHEMICAL-COMPOSITION; EMITTING-DIODES; LEAF LETTUCE; RED-LIGHT; QUALITY; BASIL; BLUE; L.	With the recent development of LED lighting systems for plant cultivation, the use of vertical farming under controlled conditions is attracting increased attention. This study investigated the impact of a number of LED light spectra (red, blue, green and white) on the growth, development and essential oil content of lemon balm (Melissa officinalis), a herb and pharmaceutical plant species used across the world. White light and red-rich light spectra gave the best outputs in terms of impact on the growth and yield. For blue-rich spectra, the development and yield was lower despite having a significant impact on the photosynthesis activity, including Fv/Fm and NDVI values. For the blue-rich spectra, a peak wavelength of 450 mn was better than that of 435 nm. The results have practical value in terms of increased yield and the reduction of electricity consumption under controlled environmental conditions for the commercial production of lemon balm.

However, most of the studies to date have focused on light and temperature extremes, while the adaptive responses and underlying mechanisms of plants to non-stress light intensity (LI) and night temperature (NT) largely remain elusive. Here, we investigated the growth and physiological responses of tomatoes grown under three LI regimes of 250 (L-L), 300 (L-M), and 350 (L-H) mu mol m(-2) s(-1), respectively, combined with two NT conditions. The results revealed that increased LI comprehensively improved tomato growth and physiological status at lower NT levels, but the growth stimulations induced by increasing LI were limited by higher NT. In addition, the lower NT at L-M and L-H conferred a relatively better endogenous physiological condition and significantly promoted tomato growth, but the higher NT significantly accelerated shoot growth at L-L, indicating a compensation of higher NT for low light induced growth restriction. Taken together, the current study suggests that the adaptation mechanism of tomato plants to higher NT varied with LI levels, and higher LI plus lower NT would be an effective strategy to improve tomato growth.

Experiments with lettuce, Lactuca sativa L., plants using artificial lighting based on narrow-band LEDs were carried out in a controlled environment. We investigated plant responses to the exclusion of certain spectral ranges of light in the region of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR); in comparison, the responses to quasimonochromatic radiation in the red and blue regions were studied separately. The data on plant phenotyping, photosynthetic activity determination, and PAM fluorometry, indicating plant functional activity and stress responses to anomalous light environments, are presented. The study on carbon isotopic composition of photoassimilates in the diel cycle made it possible to characterize the balance of carboxylation and photorespiration processes in the leaves, using a previously developed oscillatory model of photosynthesis. Thus, the share of plant photorespiration (related to plant biomass enrichment with C-13) increased in response to red-light action, while blue light accelerated carboxylation (related to C-12 enrichment). Blue light also reduced water use efficiency. These data are supported by the observations from the light environments missing distinct PAR spectrum regions. The fact that light of different wavelengths affects the isotopic composition of total carbon allowed us to elucidate the nature of its action on the organization of plant metabolism.

Therefore, this study investigated the combined effect of light intensity (100, 200, and 300 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) and air velocity (0.25, 0.50, and 0.75 m s(-1)) on the sensible heat flux (S-h), convection regime (CR), and latent heat flux (L-h) of lettuce plants grown in a plant factory with artificial light. The growth, photosynthetic rate, and occurrence of tipburn in lettuce plants were also evaluated. The effect of light intensity and air velocity on the thermal exchange of indoor-cultured lettuce was achieved through their combined effect on conductance to heat and mass transfer. Stomatal conductance was found to be strongly correlated with light intensity, with a correlation coefficient of 73%. The boundary layer conductance was highly correlated with air velocity, with a correlation coefficient of 96%. Accordingly, the S-h and L-h increased by 41.0% and 46.9%, respectively, with an increase in light intensity from 100 to 300 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), and by 33.2% and 30.4%, respectively, with an increase in air velocity from 0.25 to 0.75 m s(-1). Air velocity had a greater impact on CR, and forced convection was dominant between lettuce plants and the surrounding air. During the dark period, a decrease in stomatal conductance was accompanied by a decrease in L-h, particularly as air velocity increased. The photosynthetic rate and fresh weight of lettuce plants were strongly correlated with light intensity, and increased by 60.9% and 54.7%, respectively, as light intensity increased from 100 to 300 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). However, the occurrence of tipburn in lettuce plants was significantly related to light intensity, and the highest number of lettuce leaves injured with tipburn of 5 leaves/plant was observed at a light intensity of 300 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). When air velocity increased from 0.25 to 0.75 m s(-1), the occurrence of tipburn decreased by 87.3%. Our results reveal that there was an obvious interaction between light intensity and air velocity on the thermal exchange, growth, and occurrence of tipburn in indoor-cultured lettuce. This study provides valuable insights into the combinational regulation of light intensity and air velocity for improving the growth and marketability of indoor-cultured lettuce.

Meyer) sprouts aeroponically grown in plant factories	HORTICULTURE ENVIRONMENT AND BIOTECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Aeroponics; Light quality; Medicinal plant; Saponin; Stem hardness	SECONDARY METABOLITES; PRODUCTION SYSTEM; LED LIGHT; RADIATION; RESPONSES; LEAVES; STRESS; ANTIOXIDANT; EFFICIENCY; ENZYMES	Ginseng (Panax ginseng C. A. Meyer) sprouts have a high content of saponins (ginsenosides) in their shoots, and their value as medicinal vegetables is increasing. However, there are no standardized cultivation guidelines for ginseng sprouts for raw foods, and the effect of light quality on growth and ginsenoside content in ginseng sprouts is not clear. The objective of this study was to analyze the growth and ginsenoside content of ginseng sprouts aeroponically grown in plant factories under supplemental far-red and ultraviolet-B (UV-B) light treatments. One-year-old ginseng seedlings were transplanted into a plant factory with a photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) of 50 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) using light-emitting diodes of red:blue = 1:1. Based on the phytochrome photostationary state value of solar radiation equal to 0.72, far-red light treatment with 18 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) for 16 h per day was applied from 0, 6, and 12 days after transplanting (DAT). For UV-B light treatments, different UV-B radiation exposure times with 0.1 W m(-2) dose were applied for 1, 2, and 3 h on the day before harvest. Under the control condition, stem hardness steeply increased after 18 DAT, making raw consumption of whole ginseng sprouts difficult. When the far-red light was applied, the electron transport rates of photosystems II and I of ginseng leaves increased and nonphotochemical quenching decreased at a high PPFD range, but no differences were found at 50 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). Far-red light treatments significantly lowered the stem hardness but did not induce significant differences in other growth factors or ginsenoside contents regardless of duration. Under additional UV-B radiation, no significant differences in photochemical characteristics or ginsenoside content were observed. As a result, additional far-red lighting can be utilized to maintain low stem hardness and extend the cultivation period.

J	Lee, JY; Son, KH; Lee, JH; Oh, MM				Lee, Ji-Yoon; Son, Ki-Ho; Lee, Jin-Hui; Oh, Myung-Min			Growth characteristics and bioactive compounds of dropwort subjected to high CO2 concentrations and water deficit	HORTICULTURE ENVIRONMENT AND BIOTECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Anthocyanin; Drought stress; Elevated CO2 concentration; Oenanthe stolonifera; Primary metabolites; Secondary metabolites	ELEVATED CO2; ATMOSPHERIC CO2; DROUGHT STRESS; ANTHOCYANIN PRODUCTION; SECONDARY METABOLITES; ANTIOXIDANT; ENRICHMENT; RESPONSES; LEAVES; PLANTS	Here, we determined the effects of mild water deficit (WD) and high CO2 concentration (HC) on the growth and bioactive compounds of dropwort and proposed culture conditions for producing high-quality plants. Plantlets with two to three offshoots were transplanted to a controlled environment room with artificial light and cultivated for 6 weeks. To investigate the effects of HC, plantlets were grown under relatively low CO2 concentration (LC; 600 mu mol mol(-1) CO2) or HC (1000 mu mol mol(-1) CO2) conditions for 6 weeks (HC6) or grown under standard conditions for 3 weeks and transferred to HC conditions for the remaining 3 weeks (HC3). To investigate the effects of WD, control plantlets were subirrigated by keeping the pots in a tray of nutrient solution, whereas WD-treated plants were allowed to absorb water through wicks extending from the pot bottoms to a nutrient solution below. Leaf water potential of WD-treated plantlets was significantly lower than that of controls. Both WD and HC significantly decreased leaf area but did not significantly affect shoot fresh and dry weights. The photosynthetic rates of HC6- and HC3-treated plantlets were 53% and 64% greater, respectively, than that of LC; the stomatal conductance and transpiration rate exhibited opposite trends. WD significantly decreased net photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate, and stomatal conductance. The total nonstructural carbohydrate content of HC6- and HC3-treated plantlets was 8% and 14% greater, respectively, than that of LC. Total phenolic content and antioxidant capacity of WD plantlets were 17% and 23% greater, respectively, than those of controls. In controls, total phenolic content of HC6- and HC3-treated plantlets was increased significantly (by 24% and 34%, respectively) than that of LC plantlets. Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) activity of WD-treated plantlets was 14% higher than that of controls; in the controls, PAL activity of HC-treated plantlets increased significantly (by 19%) compared to that of LC plantlets. However, HC did not affect PAL activity under WD. Cyanidin content was increased by both WD and HC treatments. These results indicate that reddish small dropwort (WD treated plantlets) is more useful than greenish dropwort as a functional food and can be easily produced through HC when grown in a closed environment (e.g., a greenhouse or plant factory). Finally, the cultural practice of HC can improve the industrial value of small dropwort grown for food processing.

The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of short-term irradiation with UV-A light-emitting diodes (LEDs) on the growth and bioactive substances of kale (Brassica oleracea var. acephala). Two-week-old kale seedlings were cultivated for 3 weeks in a plant factory illuminated with LEDs (red:white:blue = 8:1:1) of 150 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) photosynthetic photon flux density. Then, the plants were continuously exposed to five peak wavelengths (365, 375, 385, 395, and 405 nm) of UV-A LEDs with an energy of 30 W m(-2) in addition to the background lighting for 7 days. Treatments with 395 and 405 nm wavelengths increased most of the assessed growth characteristics and photosynthetic rates compared to the control after 7 days of treatment. The maximum quantum efficiency of photosystem II (Fv/Fm) value started to decrease after 1 day of treatment, and after 5 days, we detected an increase in the concentration of reactive oxygen species with a decrease in the wavelength of the UV-A light treatment. There were increases in the total phenolic and flavonoid contents and antioxidant levels of kale plants subjected to all of the UV-A LEDs compared with control plants after 7 days. Our observations indicated that phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) and chalcone synthase gene expression and PAL enzyme activity were upregulated by the UV-A LED treatments, although no significant differences among treatments were detected. Collectively, our results indicate that kale biomass and bioactive compounds can be enhanced through supplementary UV-A radiation, with 405-nm LEDs having the best effects, thereby suggesting that it would be beneficial to conduct additional research on the spectral threshold between UV-A and deep-blue light.

Exploring the effects of light on autotoxin secretion in lettuce can be helpful for improving the utilization efficiency of the nutrient solution in plant factories. The effects of white light (WL) and the combination of red (R) and blue (B) light (RB, 4R:1B) at different intensities (150, 200, and 250 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) on the growth and root exudates of hydroponic lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) were studied in a closed plant factory. The lettuce biomass and photosynthetic rate increased with the increasing light intensity, and the photosynthetic rate was significantly lower under WL than under RB at both 200 and 250 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). Lettuce under WL had the longest root length and highest root surface area at 200 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), while the root length, root surface area, and root volume under RB were the highest at 250 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). Total organic carbon (TOC) content of root exudates in the nutrient solution based on shoot or root dry weight decreased with the increasing light intensity. With the increase in light intensity, the secretion of four autotoxins (benzoic acid, ferulic acid, gallic acid, and tannic acid) based on shoot dry weight and root dry weight decreased under WL. Compared with RB, WL significantly reduced the secretion of autotoxins at 250 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). In conclusion, 250 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) white light should be used for high lettuce yield, and it could also decrease the autotoxins in the nutrient solution and the occurrence of autotoxicity.

J	Chen, YH; Matsuda, R; Fujiwara, K				Chen, Yuanhao; Matsuda, Ryo; Fujiwara, Kazuhiro			Rapid and semi-automated leaf net photosynthetic rate determination for numerous phosphor-converted white-LED lights of different spectral distributions	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL METEOROLOGY			English	Article						LED-artificial sunlight source system; Lettuce; Plant factories with artificial light; Spectral photon-flux-density distribution	BLUE-LIGHT; QUANTUM YIELD; RED-LIGHT; GROWTH; MORPHOLOGY; LETTUCE	Phosphor-converted white LEDs (PCW-LEDs) of numerous types with different relative spectral photon-flux-density distributions (SPDs) are commercially available today. Some are regarded as promising light sources for use in plant factories with artificial lighting. The leaf net photosynthetic rate (P-n) measured under PCW-LED light is an important criterion for evaluating PCW-LEDs in terms of photosynthesis performance. To ascertain P-n rapidly under dozens of PCW-LED lights having different SPDs, we have developed a rapid and semi-automated P-n-quantification method. The method uses a modified LED-artificial sunlight source system (LASS system) and a P-n-measurement system. The modified LASS system can produce light with an SPD, which can accurately approximate that of any PCW-LED light at a photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) of 150 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). First, PCW-LED lights of 30 types at a PPFD of 150 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) were produced using the modified LASS system within 2.5 h. We then measured the Pn of cos lettuce, red-leaf lettuce, and green-leaf lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) plants. In a 16-h P-n measurement repetition, the modified LASS system supplied all the produced lights automatically and successively to an identical leaf of a lettuce plant. A P-n-measurement system simultaneously measured Pn under the produced light. Results show that the mean P-n values of the cos lettuce, red-leaf lettuce, and green-leaf lettuce under the 30 produced lights at 20 days after sowing were, respectively, 7.11-8.02, 5.76-7.11, and 4.83-6.17 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). A rapid and semi-automated method was developed for successive measurement of Pn under dozens of combined lights, of which each SPD approximated that of the selected PCW-LED lights, within days, which indicates that the method can determine the P-n quickly under numerous PCW-LED lights. Results show that the system contributes to rapid selection of PCW-LED lights performing high P-n.

Advances in light-emitting diodes (LED) have enabled the study of the effect of narrow wavelengths on plant growth and antioxidant compound synthesis. LED technology also facilitates the incorporation of light sources in a controlled setting where light spectra and intensity can be regulated. The objective of this study was to compare the effect of two commercial light spectra (Si: standard white light with 32.8% blue. 42.5% green, 21.7% red, and 2.4% far-red; S2: AP67 spectrum, designed for horticultural growth, with 16.9% blue, 20.5% green, 49.7% red and 12.3% far red) at two light intensities [low intensity (78 mu mol.m(-2)s(-1) of photons for Si and 62 mu mol.m(-2)s(-1) for S2, and high intensity (HI) (102 and 100 mu mol.m(-2)s(-1) for S1 and S2, respectively)] on growth and antioxidant compound contents in two leafy vegetables: endive (Cichorium endivia L.) and lettuce (Lactuca saliva L.). Fresh weight (FW), dry weight (DW), and DW% of plants were taken as growth indicators. In addition, leaf number, soil plant analysis development index, leaf area (LA), and specific leaf area were also evaluated. Antioxidant synthesis was measured as total phenol content, total flavonoid content, and antioxidant activity. The results showed that S2 and HI increased the FW, DW, and LA in both species. On the other hand, antioxidant compound contents were significantly increased by HI but did not vary with the spectnun.

In Mexico there is a lack of research on its use in small-scale vertical farms with hydroponics established in urban agriculture. The objective of this work was to measure the response of three commercial lamps with LED lights on the growth and morphogenesis of sangria lettuce grown in a lowcost home vertical farm. The sangria lettuce was subjected to three light intensities with different spectra and photoperiod. After 30 days of growth the plant height, leaf length, leaf width, number of leaves and fresh weight were measured, with these measurements a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed and Duncan's multiple comparison method was used through an algorithm designed in Python. According to the results, the highest fresh weight was observed for a light intensity of 5700 lux. In the 2100 lux treatment, the highest height of the plant was observed and it was the treatment with the highest energy consumption. The production of lettuce at home is technically feasible, however, in addition to the light intensity, it is necessary to evaluate the quality (wavelengths) from the agronomic point of view.

However, despite the controlled environment in PFALs, variations in plant individuals have been found, which affect productivity in PFAL operations. Plant phenotyping plays a crucial role in understanding how the surrounding microenvironment affects variations in plant phenotypes. In the current study, a modular phenotyping system for seedling production was developed, focusing on practicality and scalability in commercial PFALs. Experiments on seedlings, which strongly affect productivity, were conducted to obtain cotyledon unfolding time and the time series projected area of cotyledons and true leaves of individual seedlings of romaine lettuce (Lactuca sativa L. var. longifolia), using RGB images. This was also undertaken to analyze how the surrounding microenvironment of photosynthetic photon flux densities and nutrients affect growth variations for plant cohort research. In agreement with the actual measurements, variations in seedling growth were identified even under similar microenvironments. Furthermore, the results demonstrated larger variations in seedlings with higher relative growth. Aiming for simplified interactions of phenotypes with the microenvironment, management, and genotype, seedling selection and breeding with plant production in PFALs may enable plant uniformity and higher productivity.

However, few studies have been reported on cultivation in a controlled environment for improving productivity. We performed two experiments to investigate the effects of photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD; 300, 500, and 700 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) with white light and light quality (white, R3B1 (red:blue = 3:1), and R9B1) with a PPFD of 300 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) on plant growth and radiation-use efficiency (RUE) of a dwarf tomato cultivar ('Micro-Tom') at the vegetative growth stage. The results clearly demonstrated that higher PPFD leads to higher dry mass and lower specific leaf area, but it does not affect the stem length. Furthermore, high PPFD increased the photosynthetic rate (Pn) of individual leaves but decreased RUE. A higher blue light proportion inhibited dry mass production with the same intercepted light because the leaves under high blue light proportion had low Pn and photosynthetic light-use efficiency. In conclusion, 300 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) PPFD and R9B1 are the recommended proper PPFD and light quality, respectively, for 'Micro-Tom' cultivation at the vegetative growth stage to increase the RUE.

The two sections were set as (1) section irradiated only by fluorescent lamps (main wavelengths 433, 543, and 610 nm; 230 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1) of photosynthetic photon flux density) and non-treated with UV-A irradiation (hereafter, non-UVA), and (2) section irradiated with fluorescent lamps and treated with UV-A irradiation (maximum peak emission: 352 nm; 15.1 W.m(-2) ultraviolet radiation intensity; hereafter, t-UVA). The fruit weight per plant and the number of fruits per plant were not significantly affected by cultivar or section. Regarding fruit quality, the fruit cracking rate was lower in the t-UVA than in non-UVA section. There were no anatomical or histochemical differences in fruit structure or distribution of pigments such as lycopene or beta-carotene, but the shape of the pigment in the epidermal cells was needle-shaped in the non-UVA and unclearly-shaped in the t-UVA, so the pigment shape was different between the two sections. In addition, the number of layers of the hypodermis in the exocarp that accumulated the pigment was smaller in the t-UVA than in non-UVA section. Fruit components in t-UVA showed increased total soluble solids (TSS), titratable acidity (TA), and ascorbic acid content, but a decreased carotenoid content. Therefore, it was shown that UV-A irradiation had a positive effect on the TSS, TA and ascorbic acid content and had a negative effect on the size of the fruit per fruit and the carotenoid content. UV irradiation did not affect the yield per plant. Comparing 'Red Robin' and 'Tiny Tim Red', there was no significant difference in yield, but the fruit size of 'Red Robin' was larger, while and the fruit component of 'Tiny Tim Red' was higher than that of 'Red Robin'. In conclusion, when cultivating tomato plants in a plant factory, further improvements in fruit size and composition are expected by appropriately adjusting the time and intensity of UV irradiation for each cultivar.

J	Kuankid, S; Aurasopon, A				Kuankid, Sanya; Aurasopon, Apinan			The Effect of LED Lighting on Lettuce Growth in a Vertical IoT-Based Indoor Hydroponic System	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ONLINE AND BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						vertical agriculture; vertical farming; LED lighting; hydroponics; Internet of Things (IoT); ESP8266	BLUE	Indoor vertical hydroponics is one of the most recent agricultural technologies introduced. It is a method of growing plants in vertically stacked layers using water and nutrient solutions instead of soil. When cultivating such a system, utilizing and maintaining the quality of water and nutrients is critical for plant growth. Additionally, LED growth lights have a significant effect on plants. Despite developments in LED lighting and Internet of Things based smart agriculture systems, there is a lack of information on LED lighting for hydroponically grown crops in vertical culture since vertical agriculture is a relatively new field of study. Thus, this research aimed to develop an Internet of Things based agricultural system to automated control LED-based artificial lighting on crop cultivation and explore the effects of different LED lights on plant growth. Numerous sensors were installed and monitored to measure the Potential of Hydrogen ion, Electrical Conductivity, and other parameters in the Internet of Things based system. The Blynk application can remotely control the LEDs and monitor the entire sensor and actuator. As for the effects of LED light, particularly the red and blue light, we utilize a case study of three LED grow light models from the manufacturer as light treatments for cultivating green leaf lettuce (Lactuca sativa). The result showed that increased red light (RED/BLUE = 2:1) increased plant height, leaf width, and leaf length on both harvesting days (10 and 20 day after transplanting). The lettuce plant shape and size signify that the lettuces in each tier are of a good standard and comparable in size.

The effects of illumination quality and intensity on the growth and morphogenesis of many plant species have been examined, but improvements are needed to optimize the illumination systems for better plant products with lower resource investments. In particular, new strategies are needed to reduce the wastage of plant products related to leaf senescence, and to better control the ingredients and appearance of leafy vegetables. Although the quality of light is often altered to change the characteristics of plant products, the transcriptional status underlying the physiological responses of plants to light has not been established. Herein, we performed a comprehensive gene expression analysis using RNA-sequencing to determine how red, blue, and red/blue LEDs and fluorescent light sources affect transcriptome involved in the leaf aging of leaf lettuce. The RNA-sequencing profiling revealed clear differences in the transcriptome between young and old leaves. Red LED light caused large variation between the two age classes, while a pure or mixed blue LED light spectrum induced fewer transcriptome differences between young and old leaves. Collectively, the expression levels of genes that showed homology with those of other model organisms provide a detailed physiological overview, incorporating such characteristics as the senescence, nutrient deficiency, and anthocyanin synthesis of the leaf lettuce plants. Our findings suggest that transcriptome profiles of leaf lettuce grown under different light sources provide helpful information to achieve better growth conditions for marketable and efficient green-vegetable production, with improved wastage control and efficient nutrient inputs.

To understand the optimal lighting direction for better growth and development, this study investigated how strawberries respond to variations in the lighting direction to help fine-tune the growth environment for their development. We examined how the lighting direction affects plant morphophysiology by investigating plant growth parameters, leaf anatomy, epidermal cell elongation, stomatal properties, physiological characteristics, and expressions of runner induction-related genes (FaSOC1 and FaTFL1) and gibberellin (GA) biosyntheses-related genes (FaGA20ox2 and FaGA20ox4). In closed-type plant factory units, the rooted cuttings of strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa Duch.) 'Suhlyang' were subjected to a 10-h photoperiod with a 350 mu mol center dot m(-2)center dot s(-1) photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) provided by light-emitting diodes (LEDs) from three directions relative to the plants: top, side, and bottom. Our results demonstrated that the side lighting profoundly promoted not only morphophysiology, but also runner formation, by upregulating photosynthesis in strawberries. Side lighting can bring commercial benefits, which include reduced economic costs, easier controllability, and harmlessness to plants. This will help provide new insights for the propagation of the most commonly cultivated strawberries in South Korea.

We installed sensors to observe the environmental factors in a plant factory and evaluated lettuce growth. We found that the integrated quantity of PPFD (Photosynthetic Photon Flux Density) is correlated with fresh weight of harvested leaf lettuces and that lettuce density also affects growth. There is the relationship between adjacent and central plant stocks. The influence of planting density was observed, and thinning improved the growing conditions at many planting positions. On the other hand, it was concluded that the air temperature and humidity were uniform in the plant cultivation bed and did not affect the growing condition. It was observed that the air temperature, humidity and wind speed were affected when the cultivation bed was in front of the air conditioning port. The CO2 concentration was controlled within a range that did not affect the growth.

Moreover, we quantified the expression levels of genes related to bioactive compounds synthesis in response to UV-B radiation. Canola seedlings were cultivated in a plant factory under artificial light (200 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) photosynthetic photon flux density; white LED lamps; 16 h on/8 h off), 25 degrees C/20 degrees C daytime/nighttime air temperature, and 70% relative humidity. Eighteen days after sowing, the seedlings were subjected to supplemental UV-B treatment. The control plants received no UV-B irradiation. The plants were exposed to 3, 5, or 7 W m(-2) UV-B irradiation. There were no significant differences in shoot fresh weight between the UV-B-irradiated and control plants. With increasing UV-B irradiation intensity and exposure time, the H2O2 content gradually increased, the expression levels of genes related to photosynthesis downregulated, and phenylpropanoid and flavonoid production, and also total phenolic, flavonoid, antioxidant, and anthocyanin concentrations were significantly enhanced. The genes related to secondary metabolite biosynthesis were immediately upregulated after UV-B irradiation. The relative gene expression patterns identified using qRT-PCR corroborated the variations in gene expression that were revealed using microarray analysis. The time point at which the genes were induced varied with the gene location along the biosynthetic pathway. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate a temporal difference between the accumulation of antioxidants and the induction of genes related to the synthesis of this compound in UV-B-treated canola plants. Our results demonstrated that short-term UV-B irradiation could augment antioxidant biosynthesis in canola without sacrificing crop yield or quality.

Effects of supplemental light qualities on morphology and physiology as well as health-promoting compounds of Chinese kale baby leaves were investigated. Application of UV-A and FR presented a positive effect on biomass, with a pronounced increase in petiole length, stem diameter, main stem length, and leaf area. Notably, plants under UF grew more vigorously than under other treatments. Higher levels of FRAP, vitamin C, total phenolic, and flavonoid were observed in plants under UV-A, while no striking changes or a decreasing trend recorded under FR and UF. Moreover, UV-A enhanced the glucosinolates (GLs) accumulation in Chinese kale baby leaves by increasing the predominant GLs (glucoraphanin and glucobrassicin) contents. RT-qPCR results indicated that UV-A upregulated the gene expressions of transcription factors and core structure genes related to GLs biosynthesis. However, downregulated or unchanged gene expressions of GLs biosynthesis-related genes in Chinese kale baby leaves were observed in FR and UF. Therefore, UV-A was benefited for the production of functional substances, while FR was conducive to a significant increase in crop yield. The combination of UV-A and FR, as a balance between yield and production of secondary metabolite, provided a new perspective for the application of artificial light in horticultural crop production.

These offer precise regulation of the crop environment, but optimal light requirements vary between species and according to grower specifications. Here we introduce a novel assessment framework to optimise light quality in urban plant factories accounting for yield, resource use efficiency and flavour, factors that have only been studied separately in previous research. Yield, water and energy use efficiency and flavour of sweet basil (Ocimum basilicum cv. Genovese) and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum cv. Micro-Tom) were determined for plants grown supplied with 100% blue, 66% blue + 33% red, 33% blue + 66% red, or 100% red lighting. In both species, 66% red and 100% red optimised water use efficiency and energy use respectively. For basil, 100% blue light maximised leaf biomass, while 66% red enhanced leaf flavouring volatiles. In Micro-Tom, all treatments produced similar fruit biomass, but 100% red light enhanced flavour-related volatiles in foliage. By considering trade-offs between yield, efficiency and flavour, growers can select bespoke lighting treatments to optimise their product according to specific market demands and minimise environmental impacts.

In Expt. 1, 'Emerald' and 'Snowchaser' transplants were acclimated for 8 weeks under PPFDs of 35, 70, 105, or 140 +/- 5 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1) provided by W LED fixtures for 20 h.d(-1). In another treatment, PPFD was increased over time by moving transplants from treatment compartments providing 70 to 140 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1) at the end of week 4. Transplants were also acclimated in either a research or a commercial greenhouse (RGH or CGH, respectively). Shrinkage was unaffected by PPFD, but all transplants acclimated indoors had lower shrinkage (<= 4%) than those in the greenhouse (15% and 17% in RGH and CGH, respectively), and generally produced more shoot and root biomass, regardless of PPFD. Growth responses to increasing PPFD were linear in most cases, although treatment effects after finishing were generally not significant among PPFD treatments. In Expt. 2, 'Emerald' transplants were acclimated for 8 weeks under constant W, W + red (WR), or W + FR (WFR) radiation, all of which provided a PPFD of 70 +/- 2 lmol.m(-2).s(-1) for 20 h.d(-1). At the end of week 4, a group of transplants from WR and WFR were moved to treatment compartments with W (WRW or WFRW, respectively) or from W to a research greenhouse (W-GH), where another group of transplants were also acclimated for 8 weeks (GH). Shrinkage of transplants acclimated indoors was also low in Expt. 2, ranging from 1% to 4%. In contrast, shrinkage of transplants acclimated in GH or under W-GH was 37% or 14%, respectively. Growth of indoor-acclimated transplants was generally greater than that in GH or under W-GH. Although growth responses were generally similar indoors, plants acclimated under WFR had a higher root dry mass (DM) and longer roots compared with GH and W-GH.

Photosynthetic responses and reproductive ability of strawberry following sunlight application in a plant factory closed system in subtropical Okinawa	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE			English	Article						day length; light fluctuation; net photosynthetic rate; reproductive growth; solar plant factory (SPF); vegetative; growth	LIGHT-INTENSITY; GROWTH; PRODUCTIVITY; YIELD	Sunlight is an abundant source of green energy that gives an energy-saving solution when introduced into a plant factory. However, a limitation point of applying sunlight is that it is unstable on cloudy and rainy days, and it fluctuates by seasons. Aiming to produce strawberry in subtropical areas, we investigated the effects of different light conditions on photosynthetic responses and reproductive ability of strawberry grown in a closed-type plant factory using sunlight (solar plant factory, SPF). The strawberries were grown under two different light conditions [full sunlight (S) or 10% sunlight + fluorescent light (SA)] with a CO2 concentration of 1,200 pmol mol-1 and a relative humidity of 50% +/- 10%. The results showed that under long-day conditions, the response of net photosynthetic rate (Pn) of the strawberries leaves to different light levels did not differ between the two light conditions and was equal to that of plants grown in a CO2-enriched greenhouse. However, due to lower light intensity under short-day conditions, the response of Pn of the plants was significantly reduced in S treatment compared with that in SA treatment. Supplemented lighting to stabilize the light intensity showed effectiveness in improving Pn under the short-day conditions. The strawberries grown in SPF showed a high potential to produce flowers and fruits, which were not inferior to those under other controlled environment productions. These results can be overcome by additional lighting utilization.	[Le, L. T.; Takaragawa, H.; Watanabe, K.; Ureshino, K.; Kawamitsu, Y.] Univ Ryukyus, Fac Agr, Nishihara, Okinawa, Japan; [Le, L.

Lettuce plants under WB had redder leaf color and significantly higher contents of pigments, such as chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, chlorophyll (a + b) and anthocyanins. The accumulation of health-promoting compounds, such as vitamin C, vitamin A, total phenolic compounds, total flavonoids and anthocyanins in the two lettuce cultivars were obviously enhanced by WB. Lettuce under WFR showed remarkable increase in fresh weight and dry weight; meanwhile, significant decreases of pigments, total phenolic compounds, total flavonoids and vitamin C were found. Thus, in the plant factory system, the application of WB can improve the coloration and quality of red leaf lettuce while WFR was encouraged for the purpose of elevating the yield of lettuce.

The plant factories might be one of the ways to solve the shortage of MCB supply. In this study, the MCB seedlings were treated under the red (R) and blue (B) lights in the plant factory. Results showed that the red light promoted the growth and development of MCB in comparison with the blue light. Under the red-light condition, the biomass, plant height, and root characteristics were significantly higher than those under blue-light condition, while the soil and plant analyzer development (SPAD) under the red-light treatment was significantly lower than that under the blue-light treatment. Red light also significantly promoted the content of soluble sugar and pectin of MCB compared with blue light. Transcriptome analysis showed that a total of 4,165 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected including 2,034 upregulated and 2,131 downregulated. Of these, 1,112 DEGs including 410 upregulated and 702 downregulated genes were associated with 111 pathways. Moreover, a total of 8,723 differentially expressed transcription factors (TFs) were identified in R vs. B, and these TFs were distributed in 56 gene families. Metabonomic results revealed that a total of 184 metabolites and 99 differentially expressed metabolites (DEMs) (42 upregulated and 57 downregulated) were identified in the red- and blue-light treatments. Integrative analysis of transcriptome and metabolome unveiled that a total of 24 pathways included 70 compounds (metabolites) and were associated with 28 unigenes. In particular, these pathways included starch and sucrose metabolism, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, cysteine and methionine metabolism, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, and pentose and glucuronate interconversions. The unigenes included asparagine synthetase (AS), thymidine kinase (TK), alpha, alpha-trehalose-phosphate synthase (TPS), phosphatase IMPL1 (IMPL1), dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (D4R), and 4-coumarate-CoA ligase-like 6 (4CL6), bifunctional aspartokinase-homoserine dehydrogenase 1 (thrA), and abscisic acid 8 '-hydroxylase 2 isoform X1 (ABA8). It was indicated that these pathways and genes might play important roles in the growth and development of MCB. This study laid a foundation for the future research of MCB.

Artificial light sources are a critical component in the plant factory systems and red and blue wavelengths have a powerful impact on plant growth and photosynthetic capacity. In this study, the effect of different photon flux ratios of red (R) light to blue (B) LED light including 100 R:0B, 80 R:20B, 50 R:50B, 20 R:80B, 0 R:100B and white LEDs (as control) were evaluated on the growth, flowering and secondary metabolite contents of Hypericum perforatum L. cv. Topas at 150 mu mol m- 2 s- 1 irradiation for a 16/8 h.d-1 photoperiod. Results showed that the plant growth characteristics such as fresh and dry weight, leaf area and number, plant height, flower number and diameter were significantly (P < 0.05) maximum under the enhancement of R/B ratio, especially under 100% red light treatment. Despite the higher transpiration and net photosynthesis rate, photosynthetic pigment concentration, stomatal surface area and RuBisCO activity, the plants under the high fraction of blue light showed the poorest growth and flowering traits. The maximum content of hypericin (14.24 mg g-1 DW), pseudohypericin (25.98 mg g-1 DW) and hyperforin (163.06 mg g-1 DW) was obtained in flower under 100% red LED. Antioxidant enzymes activities (CAT and POD), total phenolic and flavonoid content were also higher in plants exposed to the mixture of red and blue light. Plants grown under white LED were mediocre in terms of growth parameters and secondary metabolites. These findings showed that the 100% red LED light is suitable for H. perforatum plant growth, flowering, as well as secondary metabolites accumulation in the plant factory system.

The results indicated that plant height, stem diameter, number of leaves, root length, leaf width, and maximum leaf area were all positively related to [CO2], which illustrated that growth was greater in the treatments with eCO(2) than under ambient CO2. The daily average assimilation rate (DAAR), the average dry weight growth rate (GRdw), and yield were also greater for plants grown under DA-CO2 and QA-CO2 than under ambient CO2 (DAAR increased by 25.45% and 42.27%, GRdw increased by 28.76 and 37.55%, and yield increased by 33.65 and 44.16%, respectively). Light-use efficiency increased by 28.51 and 41.12% for DA-CO2 and QA-CO2 compared with ambient CO2, respectively. We concluded that eCO(2) has the potential to enhance production as well as light utilization in PFAL.

The results showed that four LED light quality treatments (red light, blue light, red light:blue light = 8:1, red light:blue light:UV-A = 20:5:1) all increased the plant height and leaf number of container seedlings of C. camphora compared to solar light under natural conditions. Under the blue light treatment, C. camphora stocks had the lowest biomass, including number of leaves, plant height, stem diameter, and fresh/dry weight. Under the red light treatment, stomatal conductance, intercellular CO2 concentration, transpiration rate, chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b and carotenoids were the lowest. Compared with the narrow-band red or blue light treatments, plant height, leaf number, fresh weight of aboveground biomass, fresh weight of belowground biomass and chlorophyll a content were significantly increased in both of the polychromatic light treatments. The polychromatic light treatment red light:blue light:UV-A = 20:5:1 significantly increased the net photosynthetic rate of C. camphora. Therefore, the polychromatic light treatment of red and blue light for C. camphora seedlings was better than narrow-band light treatments, and the addition of UV-A radiation was beneficial in cultivating strong seedlings.

Moderate stress can enhance plant constituents that are beneficial for human health, without reducing yield. Dehydration stress in lettuce rhizospheres increased some antioxidants, including L-ascorbic acid (AsA) and polyphenols. In this study, the major factors contributing to the augmentation of antioxidant constituents were investigated. The drought treatment resulted in increased hydrophilic oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) values but not hydrophobic ORAC values. Both activities of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, SOD, and ascorbate peroxidase, APX) were elevated under drought conditions. RNA-seq analysis revealed 33 upregulated and 115 downregulated differentially expressed genes, and 40 gene ontology enrichment categories. A dehydrin gene was the most significant among the upregulated genes in response to drought stress. Dehydrin protects plant cells from dryness through multiple functions, such as radical scavenging and protection of enzymes. Real-time PCR validated the substantial increase in some dehydrin paralogs with root desiccation. In conclusion, the enhancement of antioxidant levels by drought stress is likely not due to the induction of antioxidant enzyme genes, but due to increased enzymic activities. These activities might be protected by dehydrins encoded by the upregulated paralogs under drought stress.

This study aimed to examine the effect of W LED light sources on the growth and quality of butterhead and romaine lettuce. Three W LED light sources including normal W light (NWL) which has 450 nm as its pumping wavelength and two specific W lights (SWL1 and SWL2) with shorter blue peak wavelength (437 nm) were used to grow lettuce in comparison to a red (R) and blue (B) LED combination. As a result, SWL1 and SWL2 treatments with the same electrical power or photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) resulted in more growth of both lettuce cultivars compared to RB treatment. Some phenolic and flavonol contents were increased in the RB treatment, whereas SWL2 treatment stimulated the accumulation of other phenolic and flavonol compounds. Meanwhile, neither NWL nor SWL1 treatments increased the individual phenolic and flavonol contents in either cultivar (except for some flavonols in romaine lettuce in the SWL1 group). In addition, light and energy use efficiencies were also highest in the SWL1 and SWL2 treatments. These results illustrate the positive effects of specific W LED light on lettuce growth and quality, and suggest that the specific W LED light sources, especially SWL2, could be preferably used in vertical farming.

This study was conducted to examine how lighting direction affects plant morphophysiology by investigating plant growth parameters, leaf anatomy, epidermal cell elongation, stomatal properties, chloroplast arrangement, and physiological changes. In closed-type plant factory units, the rooted cuttings of two chrysanthemum (Chrysanthemum morifolium Ramat.) cultivars, 'Gaya Glory' and 'Pearl Egg', were subjected to a 10 h photoperiod with a 300 mu mol center dot m(-2)center dot s(-1) photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) provided by light-emitting diodes (LEDs) from three directions relative to the plant including the top, side, and bottom. Compared to the top or bottom lighting, the side lighting greatly enhanced the plant growth, improved the leaf internal structure and chloroplast arrangement, induced small stomata with a higher density, and promoted stomatal opening, which is associated with an increased stomatal conductance and photosynthetic efficiency. It is worth noting that the side lighting significantly enhanced the induction of branching and flowering for both cultivars., The plants grown with side lighting consistently exhibited the greatest physiological performance. We conclude that the lighting direction had a profound effect on the morphophysiological characteristics of chrysanthemum, and that side lighting dramatically promoted their growth and development, especially in their branching and flowering.

Moreover, crops grown as microgreens are ideal for plant factories with artificial lighting, since they contain greater amounts of bioactive compounds compared to fully-grown plants. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of broad-spectra light with different red/blue ratios on the yield, morphology, and phytochemical content of seven microgreens. Mustard, radish, green basil, red amaranth, garlic chives, borage, and pea shoots were grown in a vertical farming system under three light sources emitting red/blue ratios of about 2, 5, and 9 units (RB2, RB5, and RB9, respectively). Mustard exhibited the most profound color responses. The yield was enhanced in three microgreens under RB9 and in garlic under RB2. Both the hypocotyl length and the leaf and cotyledon area were significantly enhanced by increasing the red light in three microgreens each. Total soluble solids (Brix) were reduced in 4 microgreens under RB2. The total phenolic content and antioxidant capacity were reduced under RB2 in 6 and 5 microgreens, respectively. The chlorophylls were variably affected but total the carotenoid content was reduced in RB9 in three microgreens. Overall, light wavelength differentially affected the microgreens' quality, while small interplays in spectral bands enhanced their phytochemical content.

Previously, we investigated heat tolerance in five common-market cultivars of sage plants using leaf relative injury (RI) values and found that S. elegans Vahl (SE) and S. officinalis L. (SO) were the most and least heat-tolerant species, respectively. The exogenous applications of salicylic acid (SA) and calcium chloride (CaCl2) to alleviate heat stress in various species have been extensively studied, but reports of the effects of SA and CaCl2 treatments on the heat tolerance of sage plants are scarce. The objective of this study was to investigate how SA and CaCl2 affect the physiology and morphology of SE and SO plants under high-temperature conditions. Potted plants were pretreated with SA (0, 100, 200, 400, and 800 mu M) and CaCl2 (0, 5, 10, and 15 mM), alone and combined, exposed to 55 degrees C and 80% humidity for 30 min, then placed in an environment-controlled chamber at 30 degrees C for three days and evaluated for changes in phenotypic appearance, RI, spectral reflectance, and chlorophyll fluorescence indices at different time intervals. Plants watered without chemical solutions were used as controls. Our results show that the growth of SO plants pretreated with SA and CaCl2 was more robust, compared with control plants, which were considerably affected by heat stress, resulting in brown, withered leaves and defoliation. The effects of the combined applications of SA (100 mu M) and CaCl2 (5 mM) to SO plants were superior to control plants in increasing values of soil-plant analysis development (SPAD), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and the maximal quantum yield of photosystemII photochemistry (Fv/Fm), while reducing RI%. Furthermore, SO plants exhibited higher SPAD and Fv/Fm values and lower RI% than SE plants in combined treatments at all time intervals after heat stress, implying that different genotypes displayed variations in their SPAD, Fv/Fm, and RI%. Thus, a combined treatment of 100 mu M of SA and 5 mM of CaCl2 is effective and beneficial to plant appearance and ability to ameliorate heat stress. These indices can be used as indicators to characterize the physiology of these plants and applied on a commercial scale for informing the development of rapid and precise management practices on bedded sage plants grown in plant factories to achieve maximum market benefit.

Green light can penetrate the outer leaves and reach the inner leaves to promote photochemical reaction of the overlapping leaves of head vegetables. However, whether this promotion can increase the nutritional components and change the color of the inner leaves of head cabbages, which is one of the major head vegetables largely produced worldwide, remains unclear. Therefore, we investigated the changes in the colors and the concentrations of chlorophyll (Chl) and carotenoid of the inner leaves of two types of cabbages by externally irradiating the cabbage with green light. The results showed that a short-term (48 h) irradiation with low light intensity (50 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) of green light enhanced the Chl concentration and colors of the inner leaves of cabbages, and the positive changes of these indicators increased as the leaf layers approached the head center of the cabbage. Simultaneously, we also establish a method to effectively estimate the Chl concentration using luminosity (L*) and greenness (- a*) when the Chl concentration is so low that it is difficult or not possible to be measured by SPAD meter. Our findings demonstrated that green light, as a new tool, can be used to control the colors and nutritional components of the inner leaves of cabbages. The discoveries will help produce head vegetables with the preferred phenotype desired by consumers using a plant factory with artificial lighting.

Sorting of hydroponic lettuce must be carried out before packing. Information perception and image processing of hydroponic lettuce is a crucial technology to develop a robotic sorting system. In this study, DeepLabV3+ models of deep learning technologies were employed with four backbones of ResNet-50, ResNet101, Xception-65, and Xception-71 to design a vision system of segmenting abnormal leaves (yellow, withered, and decay leaves) of hydroponic lettuce. Two weights assignation methods, i.e., median frequency weights (MFW) and uniform weights (UW), were incorporated into DeepLabV3+ and compared for performance. Results showed that models trained by UW were better than that of MFW assignation method. ResNet-101 had the best segmentation performance in UW assignation method with pixel accuracy of 99.24% and mIoU of 0.8326. In terms of speed, ResNet-50 had the fast segmentation speeds with 154.0 ms per image. This study provided object detection methodology for automatic sorting device of hydroponic lettuce.

In Chinese kale baby-leaves, supplemental 5 and 10 W center dot m(-2) UV-A (UVA-5 and UVA-10) were beneficial for inter-node length, stem diameter, canopy diameter, fresh weight and dry weight, particularly in UVA-10 treatment, while these above-mentioned growth parameters all significantly decreased in UVA-15 treatment. The soluble sugar content decreased under UVA-5, but there was no significant difference under UVA-10 and UVA-15. Soluble protein contents decreased under UVA-5 and UVA-10, but significantly increased under UVA-15. UVA-10 played a predominant role in increasing FRAP and contents of total phenolics and total flavonoids compared to other treatments. Contents of total glucosinolates (GLs), aliphatic GLs and indolic GLs in Chinese kale baby-leaves significantly increased with UV-A intensity increasing, and the highest contents were found under UVA-15. The percentage of total aliphatic GLs (about 80%) was significantly higher than those of total indolic GLs. Glucobrassicanapin and sinigrin were two major individual GLs in Chinese kale baby-leaves, variation trends of which were consistent with the contents of total GLs and aliphatic GLs. From the heatmap analysis, and taking economic benefits into account, UVA-10 might be optimal for the production of high-quality Chinese kale baby-leaves in an artificial light plant factory.

Vertical farms use engineered growth environments and hydroponic cultivation techniques for growing plants indoors. One of the important factors in vertical farming for the cultivation of different plants is the amount of nutrients, which can be measured as electrical conductivity (EC). Studying the optimal EC is important for avoiding nutrient loss and deficiency in vertical farms. In this study, we investigated the effect of five EC levels (2, 1.2, 0.9, 0.7, and 0.5 dS m(-1)) of Hoagland nutrient solution on the growth and development of basil cultivar 'Emily' and lettuce cultivar 'Batavia-Caipira'. During the study, the environmental parameters were kept fixed using an automatic dosing machine. The experiment was done in automatic vertical farms using the hydroponic ebb-flow cultivation technique with a temperature of 20 +/- 1 degrees C, relative humidity of 50-60%, CO2 concentration of 450 ppm, pH = 6, the PPFD (photosynthetic photon flux density) of 215 +/- 5.5 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), and the photoperiod of 16:8 h (day/night). Each treatment was replicated four times. We studied the effects on several growth parameters (including the dry and fresh weight of leaves and roots, number of leaves, and leaf area) as well as the chlorophyll and nitrogen concentration of the leaves. According to the results, the basil and lettuce growth parameters among the five treatments have been significantly higher in the treatment with EC of 1.2 and 0.9 dS m(-1). These EC values are lower than the recommended EC value given as the optimum in the previous studies. However, the concentration of chlorophyll and nitrogen show different trends and were higher in full strength of nutrient solution with EC = 2 dS m(-1).

High light intensity at End-Of-Production improves the nutritional value of basil but does not affect postharvest chilling tolerance	FOOD CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Chilling injury; Basil (Ocimum basilicum L.); Vertical farming; Antioxidants; Postharvest; LED light	REACTIVE OXYGEN; ASCORBIC-ACID; STRESS TOLERANCE; SHELF-LIFE; INJURY; ANTIOXIDANTS; QUALITY; PLANTS; BIOSYNTHESIS; CHLOROPLASTS	Basil suffers from chilling injury (CI) when stored at temperatures below 10-12 degrees C which seems related to the imbalance between reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidants. We hypothesized that increased light intensity applied shortly before harvest (EOP, End-Of-Production) increases nutritional value i.e. carbohydrates and antioxidants and could improve the chilling tolerance. Two basil cultivars were grown in a vertical farming set-up at a light intensity of 150 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). During the last 5 days of growth, EOP light treatments ranging from 50 to 600 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) were applied. After harvest the leaves were stored at 4 or 12 degrees C in darkness. Higher EOP light intensity increased the antioxidant (total ascorbic acid, rosmarinic acid) and carbohydrate contents at harvest. During storage antioxidants decreased more rapidly at 4 than at 12 degrees C. However, increased EOP light intensity did not alleviate chilling symptoms suggesting a minor role of antioxidants studied against chilling stress.

Fluorescent lights, white LED lights, and white plus red LED lights were applied at the growth processes of grafted tomato transplants from germination of rootstock and scion to post-grafting. Three levels of PFD (50, 100, 150 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) were set in the healing stage under each kind of light quality. The results indicated that the growth and quality of grafted tomato transplants under different broad spectrums were influenced by the ratio of red to blue light (R/B ratio) and the ratio of red to far-red light (R/FR ratio). A higher R/B ratio was beneficial to total dry matter accumulation, but excessive red light had a negative effect on the root to shoot ratio and the seedling quality index. The higher blue light and R/FR ratio suppressed stem extension synergistically. The LED lights had good abilities to promote plant compactness and leaf thickness in comparison with fluorescent lights. The plant compactness and leaf thickness increased with the increase in daily light integral in the healing stage within a range from 2.5 to 7.5 mol m(-2) d(-1) (PFD, 50 to 150 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)). Compared to fluorescent lights, the LED lights showed more than 110% electrical energy saving for lighting during the whole seedling period. Higher PFD in the healing stage did not significantly increase the consumption of electric power for lighting. White plus red LED lights with an R/B ratio of 1.2 and R/FR ratio of 16 were suggested to replace fluorescent lights for grafted tomato transplants production considering the high quality of transplants and electrical energy saving, and PFD in the healing stage was recommended to be set to 150 mu mol m(-2) s(-1).

In this study, interlayer cool airflow (ILCA) was used to introduce room air into plants' internal canopy through vent holes in cultivation boards and air layer between cultivation boards and nutrient solution surface (interlayer). By using optimal operating parameters at a room temperature of 28 degrees C, the ILCA system achieved similar cooling effects in the absence of a conventional air conditioning system and achieved an energy saving of 50.8% while bringing about positive microclimate change in the interlayer and nutrient solution. This resulted in significantly reduced root growth by 41.7% without a negative influence on lettuce crop yield. Future development in this precise microclimate control method is predicted to replace the conventional cooling (air conditioning) systems for crop production in plant factories.

This study was conducted to investigate the effects of selenium and UVA radiation, as well as their combination on growth and phytochemical contents in broccoli microgreens. There were three treatments: Se (100 mu mol/L Na2SeO3), UVA (40 mu mol/m(2)/s) and Se + UVA (with application of Se and UVA). The control (CK) was Se spraying-free and UVA radiation-free. Although treatment with Se or/and UVA inhibited plant growth of broccoli microgreens, results showed that phytochemical contents increased. Broccoli microgreens under the Se treatment had higher contents of total soluble sugars, total phenolic compounds, total flavonoids, ascorbic acid, Fe, and organic Se and had lower Zn content. The UVA treatment increased the contents of total chlorophylls, total soluble proteins, total phenolic compounds, and FRAP. However, the Se + UVA treatment displayed the most remarkable effect on the contents of total anthocyanins, glucoraphanin, total aliphatic glucosinolates, and total glucosinolates; here, significant interactions between Se and UVA were observed. This study provides valuable insights into the combinational selenium and UVA for improving the phytochemicals of microgreens grown in an artificial lighting plant factory.

Light manipulation using light-emitting diodes or LEDs can inhibit, delay, or even promote flowering. Some studies have shown that far-red (FR) light can stop flowering, but studies have not fully explored the best method involving intensity and duration to induce plant growth. This paper presents results on LED light manipulation techniques, particularly FR light, on plant flowering control and plant elongation. The light manipulation technique on the combination of colors, photoperiods, and intensities proved that it can stop flowering, and stimulate and control the growth of plants during cultivation. The system was monitored using an Internet-of-Things (IoT) remote monitoring system, and it performed data mining. The results showed that plants that were grown under artificial sunlight (T5) and normal light (T1) treatments were superior compared to others. The FR light delayed flowering until 50 days of planting and accelerated the plant growth and increased the fresh weight by 126%. The experiment showed that a high variable intensity at 300 mu mol m(-1)s(-1) showed a great performance and produced the largest leaf area of 1517.0 cm(2) and the highest fresh weight of 492.92 g. This study provides new insights to the researchers and the farming community on artificial light systems in improving plant factory production efficiency and in determining the best plant cultivation approach to create a stronger indoor farming management plant.

The aim of this study was to determine the optimal light intensity and photoperiod for increasing plant growth and glucosinolate concentration and content in watercress. Two-week-old seedlings were transplanted in a semi-deep flow technique system of a plant factory for 28 days under four photoperiod-light intensity treatments (12 h-266 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1), 16 h-200 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1), 20 h-160 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1), and 24 h-133 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1)) with the same daily light integral. The mean values of shoot fresh and dry weights were the highest under the 20 h-160 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1) treatment, although there was no significant difference. Net photosynthesis and stomatal conductance gradually decreased with decreasing light intensity and increasing photoperiod. However, total glucosinolate concentration was significantly higher under 20 h-160 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1) and 24 h-133 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1) compared with 12 h-266 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1) and 16 h-200 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1). The total glucosinolate content was the greatest under 20 h-160 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1) treatment. These data suggest that the 20 h-160 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1) treatment promoted the maximum shoot biomass and glucosinolate content in watercress. This study supplies the optimal light strategies for the future industrial large-watercress cultivation.

J	Kong, YY; Nemali, K				Kong, Yuyao; Nemali, Krishna			Blue and Far-Red Light Affect Area and Number of Individual Leaves to Influence Vegetative Growth and Pigment Synthesis in Lettuce	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE			English	Article						controlled environment agriculture; photoinhibition; phytochrome photostationary state; light interception; proximity response	EMITTING-DIODES; PHOTOSYNTHETIC EFFICIENCY; CAROTENOID BIOSYNTHESIS; QUANTUM YIELD; LEAF LETTUCE; QUALITY; ANTHOCYANIN; RADIATION; CHLOROPHYLL; SEEDLINGS	Published work indicates that high percentage of blue light can enhance pigment levels but decreases growth, while addition of far-red light to growth light can increase quantum efficiency and photosynthesis in leafy greens. Combining high-energy blue light with low-energy far-red light may increase both vegetative growth and pigment levels. However, the effect of high-energy blue and low-energy far-red light on the vegetative growth and pigments synthesis is unclear. This information can be potentially useful for enhancing the levels of pigments with nutritional value (e.g., beta-carotene and anthocyanins) in the produce grown in vertical farms. We grew romaine lettuce (cv. Amadeus) under similar light intensity (approximately 130 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1)) but different proportions of red: blue: far-red including 90:10: 0 ("High-R"), 50: 50: 0 ("High-B"), and 42: 42: 16 ("High-B+FR") for 31 days. Results indicated that canopy area and leaf photosynthetic rate of lettuce plants was reduced in the High-B, thereby reducing plant growth. We did not observe photosynthesis enhancement in the High-B+FR. Instead, plants clearly showed photomorphogenic effects. The phytochrome photostationary state (PSS) decreased with far-red addition, resulting in reduced leaf number per plant. This was likely to shift the allocation of resources toward elongation growth for shade avoidance. Further, we observed an increase in the area of individual leaves, canopy area, and shoot dry weight in the High-B+FR. However, these appear to be an indirect consequence of decreased leaf number per plant. Our results also indicate that changes in expansion growth at individual leaf scale largely regulated pigment concentration in plants. As individual leaf area became smaller (e.g., High-B) or larger (e.g., High-B+FR), the levels of pigments including chlorophylls and beta-carotene increased or decreased, respectively. Area of individual leaves also positively influenced canopy area (and likely light interception) and shoots dry weight (or vegetative growth). Our study provides additional insights into the effects of high-energy blue and low-energy far-red light on individual leaf number and leaf growth, which appear to control plant growth and pigment levels in lettuce.

SABELLICA; DEVELOPMENTAL-STAGE; BRASSICA VEGETABLES; ABSORBING CAPACITY; GRAPEVINE LEAVES	UV-B (280-315 nm) radiation has been used as an effective tool to improve bioactive compound contents in controlled environments, such as plant factories. However, plant structure changes with growth progress induce different positional distributions of UV-B radiation interception, which cause difficulty in accurately evaluating the effects of UV-B on biosynthesis of bioactive compounds. The objective of this study was to quantitatively analyze the positional distributions of UV-B radiation interception and bioactive compound contents of kales (Brassica oleracea L. var. acephala) with growth progress and their relationships. Short-term moderate UV-B levels did not affect the plant growth and photosynthetic parameters. Spatial UV-B radiation interception was analyzed quantitatively by using 3D-scanned plant models and ray-tracing simulations. As growth progressed, the differences in absorbed UV-B energy between leaf positions were more pronounced. The concentrations of total phenolic compound (TPC) and total flavonoid compound (TFC) were higher with more cumulative absorbed UV-B energy. The cumulative UV energy yields for TFC were highest for the upper leaves of the older plants, while those for TPC were highest in the middle leaves of the younger plants. Despite the same UV-B levels, the UV-B radiation interception and UV-B susceptibility in the plants varied with leaf position and growth stage, which induced the different biosynthesis of TFC and TPC. This attempt to quantify the relationship between UV-B radiation interception and bioactive compound contents will contribute to the estimation and production of bioactive compounds in plant factories.

On the other hand, the different tomato cultivars were also considered as key factors influencing tomato productivity and quality. In this study, we examined the differences between ethylene emission characteristics of different tomato cultivars. Our results confirmed that the Dutch tomato cultivar 'Endeavour' emitted less ethylene compared to other Japanese tomato cultivars, whereas ethylene emission in 'Rinnka409' was significantly higher than that in other cultivars. We observed that the wounding treatment resulted in rapid increase in ethylene emission in tomato, and the increase in ethylene emission was much higher in the 'Momotarou Youku' cultivar than that in the 'Endeavour' cultivar. The results will be useful to maximize tomato productivity and reduce the occurrence of fruit physiological disorders in tomato production at plant factories.

This study was conducted to investigate the effects of temperature, relative humidity, and the carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration on kale growth and glucosinolate content in different growth stages of cultivation in a plant factory. Kale was grown under different temperatures (14, 17, 20, 23, and 26 degrees C), relative humidities (45, 55, 65, 75, and 85%), and CO2 concentrations (400, 700, 1000, 1300, and 1600 ppm) in a plant factory. Two and four weeks after transplantation, leaf samples were collected to evaluate the physical growth and glucosinolate contents. The statistical significance of the treatment effects was determined by two-way analysis of variance, and Duncan's multiple range test was used to compare the means. A correlation matrix was constructed to show possible linear trends among the dependent variables. The observed optimal temperature, relative humidity, and CO2 range for growth (20-23 degrees C, 85%, and 700-1000 ppm) and total glucosinolate content (14-17 degrees C, 55-75%, and 1300-1600 ppm) were different. Furthermore, the glucosinolate content in kale decreased with the increase of temperature and relative humidity levels, and increased with the increase of CO2 concentration. Most of the physical growth variables showed strong positive correlations with each other but negative correlations with glucosinolate components. The findings of this study could be used by growers to maintain optimum environmental conditions for the better growth and production of glucosinolate-rich kale leaves in protected cultivation facilities.

We applied alternating current electrodegradation (AC-ED) to fresh nonrenewed nutrient solutions (i.e. solutions remaining unchanged throughout the culture period) and once-used nonrenewed solutions (i.e. solutions that had been used for a previous culture) for detoxifying autotoxic chemicals. Four experiments were conducted in which lettuce plants were grown in different nonrenewed solutions treated with AC-ED and in renewed solution that was not treated with AC-ED. Renewed solution (50% 'Enshi' solution) was changed at 14-day intervals. In fresh starting solutions, no substantial difference was found in shoot fresh weight (SFW) between renewed and AC-ED-treated nonrenewed solutions at different intervals (experiment I) and frequencies (experiment III), but notably, the lowest yield was recorded in non-renewed solution. In contrast, in the case of once-used nonrenewed solution, weekly (experiment II) and thrice-weekly and continuous (experiment IV) AC-ED application showed significantly higher SFW compared to values for other solutions, and the lowest value was also found in nonrenewed once-used culture solution. Therefore, we recommend the application of AC-ED to non-renewed solution either thrice weekly or continuously for efficient detoxification of accumulated allelochemicals to improve the growth, yield and quality of lettuce under two or more successive cultivations in recycled hydroponics.

End-of-production (EOP) high light irradiation is an economical preharvest practice for improving product quality. Here, we studied the dynamic responses of the AsA pool and AsA metabolism in lettuce exposed to EOP high light irradiation (300, 400, and 500 mu mol m- 2s- 1) from red and blue LEDs over a 16-h time course. Compared to the control (200 mu mol m- 2s- 1), the content of AsA and total AsA (T-AsA) in lettuce leaves significantly increased after 8 h of high light irradiation, and the contents of AsA and T-AsA increased by 42.4 % and 36.9 %, respectively, under 500 mu mol m- 2s- 1 irradiation. Transcript levels of the AsA metabolism-related genes GME, GGP, GPP, GLDH, APX, MDHAR1, MDHAR2, DHAR1, DHAR2, and GR were upregulated under higher light. Likewise, the activities of AsA-related enzymes (GLDH, APX, DHAR, and GR) increased under 500 mu mol m- 2s- 1. The expression of genes (GGP, GPP, GLDH, MDHAR1, MDHAR2, DHAR1, DHAR2, and GR) was more sensitive to high light irradiation in AsA metabolism. Both high light intensity and long irradiation time increased the soluble sugar content. Moreover, high light intensity (500 mu mol m- 2s- 1) increased the content of H2O2, O2*-, and MDA in lettuce leaves, especially at 16 h. In conclusion, EOP high light increased AsA levels by upregulating the expression of genes and the activity of enzymes in AsA metabolism. The increase in soluble sugar availability and the signaling of reactive oxygen species also contributed to AsA accumulation. We therefore recommend 8 h of high light (500 mu mol m- 2s- 1) irradiation before harvest to increase the AsA content of lettuce.

In this study, lettuce seedlings were illuminated under different light-emitting diode (LED) lights, namely, red-blue (RB), red-blue-green (RBG), red-blue-purple (RBP), and red-blue-far-red (RBF) LED lights, to investigate the effect of light quality on growth, quality, and nitrogen metabolism. The combination of 75% red and 25% blue light was set as the basic light source, and 20% of green, purple and far-red light were added to basic light source, respectively. All the treatments were set to 200 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). Results showed that the fresh weight and dry weight of aboveground lettuce under RBG, RBP, and RBF treatments were significantly lower than those under the RB treatment because of the decrease in the effective photon flux density for chlorophyll absorption. The vitamin C content of the lettuce leaves was increased by about 23% with the addition of purple light. For nitrate reduction, the addition of green light significantly increased the nitrite content of the lettuce leaves. It also promoted the reduction from nitrite to ammonium through the activation of the nitrite reductase (NiR) expression and enzyme activity. The nitrate and ammonium content decreased with the addition of purple light because of the inhibited NR and NiR expression and enzyme activity. For nitrogen assimilation, individual (e.g., Asp, Glu, and Leu) and total amino acids were induced to increase by adding green, purple, and far-red light. The addition of light was hypothesized to have inhibited protein biosynthesis, thereby causing the accumulation of amino acids. Correlation analysis showed that the relative expression levels between HY5 and NR/NiR presented a significantly negative correlation. Transcription factor HY5 might mediate the regulation of light quality on nitrogen metabolism by inhibiting NR and NiR expressions. It might also exert a negative effect on nitrate reduction. Further studies via genome editing techniques on the identification of HY5 functions for nitrate assimilation will be valuable. Nevertheless, the results of this work enrich the understanding of the effect of light quality on nitrate metabolism at the level of gene expression and enzyme activity.

The purpose of this experiment was to investigate the possibility of reducing the electric power consumption required for Cape periwinkle (Catharanthus roseus L. cv. Titan rose halo) and marigold (Tagetes erecta L. cv. Antigua orange) seed germination by changing the combinations of light spectra and light exposure time, and to improving energy use efficiency at seedling stage and photomorphogenesis of roots by changing spectral distribution and daily light integral (DLI). For this purpose, an experiment using various combinations of blue476nm and red625nm spectra together with broad-spectrum lamps including Fluorescent as control, high pressure sodium and white LED lights in varying light exposure times were performed. Marigold showed maximum seed germination under 2 h of red625nm light and so that Cape periwinkle under 4 h of 70 % R625nm: 30 % B476nm. The results revealed that the modification in the spectral distribution reduced the total time to achieve maximum germination, thereby diminishing the electricity consumption. Increasing DLI, irrespective of spectral distribution, resulted in a decrease in the shoot length of the marigold, but roots showed a reverse pattern. Cape periwinkle showed the same pattern except for those under 55 % R625nm: 45 % B476nm, which needed less DLI to achieve the highest root length. Combinations of blue476nm and red625nm LEDs had better energy use efficiency than control or any other broad-spectrum lamps to produce one-milligram dry matters of the shoot and root. Increasing DLI had positive effect on the number and longitudinal growth of lateral roots, and increasing blue476nm light percentage reduced their number. This study demonstrated that it was possible to increase the germination indices, control root photomorphogenesis more precisely and improve energy use efficiency by changing light combination spectra compared to broad-spectrum lamps.

By applying a commercial soil using black peat as major constituent with 17:10:14 ratio of NPK fertilizer in this study, the growth responses of choy sum seedling to progressively increasing white LED light intensity in an indoor plant factory were investigated, where positive enhancements were observed in choy sum morphology and growth including both dry and fresh mass accumulation under higher light intensity till 400 mu mol/(m(2).s), then a reduction occurred due to light oversaturation and overheat. In indoor plant factory, the inhomogeneous distribution phenomenon of illumination level was inevitably occurred in indoor farm racks generally. For accurately evaluating the productivity of choy sum grown on such racks, a light-time-biomass response model of choy sum seedling grown at the seedling stage was thus established for the first time, which could reliably predict the production outcome of this species in indoor farming practice under various lighting condition and duration. The robustness of the model was further tested by model variation test and sufficient robustness of this model was confirmed. The new insight obtained for the light-dependence of choy sum growth and the light-time-biomass response model can be used to efficiently direct its seedling production in indoor plant factories.

In indoor vertical farms, energy consumption represents a bottleneck for both a system's affordability and environmental footprint. Although switching frequency (sf) represents a crucial factor in determining the efficacy of light emitting diodes (LED) lighting systems in converting electricity into light, the impact of sf is still underexplored. The aim of this work was to investigate the effect of LEDs sf on the productive and qualitative responses of lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.), also considering the resource use efficiency. Plants were grown for 14 days under red and blue LEDs (215 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) and 16/8 h light/dark, with a red:blue ratio of 3) characterized by two different sf for the blue diode, namely high sf (850 kHz) and low sf (293 kHz). A fluorescent light (same light intensity and photoperiod) was included. LED sf did not alter plant morphological parameters, including fresh or dry biomass, leaf number, leaf area, or water use efficiency. A low sf increased the energy use efficiency (EUE) by 40% as compared to high sf. The latter enhanced the leaf antioxidant capacity, as a consequence of increased concentrations of caftaric and chicoric acids, isoquercetin, and luteolin, consistent with the upregulation of a few genes related to the biosynthetic pathway of phenolic compounds (4C3H and DFR). The study highlights that different sf may significantly affect the EUE as well as crop nutritional properties.

The highest plant biomass was recorded in the HLI treatment, whereas LLI and GT produced similar plant biomass. However, the LLI produced vortex-like plants, which were non-marketable, while the plants in the GT were normal-shaped and saleable. Net photosynthesis was highest in the HLI and higher in the LLI than in the GT, thereby indicating that light intensity was the dominant factor affecting photosynthetic performance. Nevertheless, the unsatisfactory performance of the LLI is ascribed, not only to reduced light intensity, but also to reduced light uniformity as the LED lamps were closer to the plants than in the HLI. Furthermore, the large solar irradiance variability in the GT resulted in substantially higher adaptation to the increased light intensity compared to LLI, as indicated by chlorophyll fluorescence measurements. Light intensity and photoperiod are believed to be the primary reasons for increased nitrate content in the GT than in the vertical farming treatments.

On this basis, we investigated how lettuce plant growth and photosynthetic activity were influenced by broad and narrow light spectra in the 590-630 nm range, by creating amber and red light-emitting diode (LED) spectra that are not commercially available. Four different light spectra were outfitted from existing LEDs using shortpass and notch filters: a double peak spectrum (595 and 655 nm; referred to as 595 + 655-nm light) that excluded 630-nm light, 595-nm, 613-nm, and 633-nm light emitting at an irradiance level of 50 W.m(-2) (243-267 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1)). Shifting LED wavelengths from 595 nm to 633 nm and from 595 nm to 613 nm resulted in a biomass yield decrease of similar to 50% and similar to 80%, respectively. When 630-nm light is blocked, lettuce displayed expanded plant structures and the absence of purple pigmentation. This report presents a new and feasible approach to plant photobiology studies, by removing certain wavelengths to assess and investigate wavelength effect on plant growth and photosynthesis. Findings indicate that amber light is superior to red light for promoting photosynthetic activity and plant productivity, and this could set precedence for future work aimed at maximizing plant productivity in controlled environment agriculture.

It is often used in salads as a dietary vegetable. Attracting strong demand, it could be a good candidate crop for a plant factory with artificial lighting (PFAL) that can achieve the mass production of high-quality crops with high productivity by regulating environmental conditions such as light. In this study, two experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of continuous lighting (CL) and different daily light integrals (DLIs) under CL on the growth, secondary metabolites, and light use efficiency (LUE) of nasturtium, all of which are essential in the successful cultivation in PFALs. In Experiment 1, two lighting models, the same DLI of 17.3 mol m(-2) d(-1) but different light periods (24 and 16 h) with different light intensities (200 and 300 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), respectively), were applied to nasturtium. The results showed that leaf production, secondary metabolites, and LUE were higher under the 24-h CL treatment than under the 16-h non-CL treatment. In Experiment 2, three DLI levels (17.3, 25.9, and 34.6 mol m(-2) d(-1)) under the CL condition were applied. The results showed that the growth parameters were positively correlated with the DLI levels under CL. The lowest DLI had the highest LUE. We conclude that the mass production of nasturtium under CL in PFALs is feasible, and the yield increases as DLI increases from 17.3 to 34.6 mol m(-2) d(-1) under CL without causing physiological stress on plants.

UV-A supplementation yielded a smaller leaf area and reduced biomass and nitrate content. In contrast, it improved the chlorophyll, soluble protein, soluble sugar, vitamin C, flavonoid, polyphenol, and anthocyanin contents and the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical-scavenging rate. FR irradiation resulted in a larger leaf area, whereas the lettuce biomass remained unchanged. Irradiation with both UV-A and FR light exhibited the most remarkable effect on leaf expansion and biomass, but reduced the phytochemical contents. A significant interaction between the cultivar and supplemented light was observed for most plant parameters.

Supplementary FR reduced the GSL accumulation without apparent dose effects. As compensate, the amounts of GSL precursor free amino acids increased. Meanwhile, 22 types of free amino acids accumulated significantly, among which 11 types showed uneven increase with FR dose, indicating that FR-3 was more efficient. Besides, key enzymes functioning upstream of desufo GSL were down-regulated by supplementary FR, which might be correlated to the down-regulation of the transcriptional activators MYB28, MYB28-like, and MYB51. Furthermore, five members of down-regulated PIFs seemed to participate in FR-regulated GSL biosynthesis. In addition, both signal and dose effects were observed in FR-regulated GSL biosynthesis.

In this study, we conducted two experiments in order to investigate the favorable conditions of air temperature, light intensity and photoperiod for the production of cucumber scions and rootstocks in a plant factory with artificial lighting. Cucumber scions and rootstocks were cultivated in two combined treatments: the combination of three different levels of difference between the day and night temperature (DIF), 25/20, 26/18 and 27/16 degrees C and five different light intensity conditions of photosynthetic photon flux, 50, 100, 150, 200 and 250 mu mol center dot m(-2)center dot s(-1) was set for the first experiment, and the combination of three different photoperiod conditions, 12, 16 and 20 h center dot d(-1) and five different light intensity conditions, 50, 100, 150, 200 and 250 mu mol center dot m(-2)center dot s(-1) was set for the second experiment. In the air temperature and light intensity treatments, the hypocotyl elongation of cucumber scions and rootstocks was affected more largely by light intensity than DIF. The highest DIF treatment (27/16 degrees C) affected negatively on the accumulation of dry mass. On the contrary, the smallest DIF treatment (25/20 degrees C) was favorable for seedling growth due to lesser stress by rapid change of air temperature between photo- and dark-period. In the photoperiod and light intensity treatments, an increased DLI (daily light integral) promoted the growth of scions and rootstocks. Under the same DLI condition, the growth of scions and rootstocks increased with increasing photoperiod and decreasing light intensity. In both of experiments, while the dry weight increased with increasing the light intensity, the light use efficiencies were reduced by increasing the light intensity. Considering the growth and quality of seedlings and energy efficiency, the optimal environment conditions were represented by 25/20 degrees C of air temperature, 150 mu mol center dot m(-2)center dot s(-1) of light intensity and 16 h center dot d(-1) of photoperiod.

Four-week-old seedlings were grown in greenhouse nutrient solution as control (CT) (EC 1-3 dS m(-1)) or NSP (EC 1-6 dS m(-1)). NSP 1 dS m(-1) induced better growth characteristics, whereas higher EC levels inhibited plant growth. Most of the macro-elements contents significantly decreased under NSP 6 dS m(-1), whereas the micro-elements contents fluctuated according to EC levels. Total phenolic concentration in NSP was lower than that in CT, and total phenolic content was highest under NSP 1 dS m(-1). Total anthocyanin and antioxidant concentrations and contents increased at lower EC levels. Rosmarinic and caffeic acids concentrations increased at higher EC levels, whereas there were no significant differences in these compound contents among the EC levels. No difference in perillaldehyde concentration was observed, whereas the content was higher at lower EC levels. Overall, these results suggest that NSP 1 dS m(-1) is suitable for cultivating red perilla in plant factories.

Accordingly, this study aimed to review blue, red, and white LED light sources for efficiency and length of the growing period to produce seedlings of Scutellaria baicalensis with high nutritional value. The roots, stems, and leaves of S. baicalensis seedlings were grown under different LED lights and harvested after two and four weeks, and analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry to identify and quantify primary and secondary metabolites. Roots, particularly in the seedlings treated with white LEDs were determined to contain the greatest concentrations of the representative compounds present in S. baicalensis: baicalin, baicalein, and wogonin, which show highly strong biological properties compared to the other plant organs. A total of 50 metabolites (amino acids, sugars, sugar alcohols, organic acids, phenolic acids, and amines) were detected in the roots, stems, and leaves of S. baicalensis seedlings, and the concentrations of primary and secondary metabolites were generally decreased with the increasing duration of LED illumination. Therefore, this study suggests that white LED light and a 2-week growing period are the most efficient conditions for the production of baicalin, baicalein, and wogonin.

SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							LIGHT-EMITTING-DIODES; SUPPLEMENTAL BLUE; LEAF LETTUCE; STEM ELONGATION; GROWTH; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; PLANTS; SEEDLINGS; SPINACH; QUALITY	Since red (R) and blue (B) LED light has different quantum efficiency and photoelectric conversion efficiency, mixed RB with different proportions of R and B results in varied energy consumption. In order to improve the energy use efficiency of the closed-type plant production systems, the effects of R and B proportions on the electric use efficiency (EUE), light use efficiency (LUE) as well as the quality of butter leaf lettuce were evaluated in this study. Lettuce seedlings were cultivated in a plant factory with artificial lighting (PFAL) and subjected to eleven combinations of R and B (100%R, 90%R, 80%R, 70%R, 60%R, 50%R, 40%R, 30%R, 20%R, 10%R, 0%R; the rest of the photons in each treatment were B) with the same total photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) and photoperiod (200 +/- 3 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1), 16 h) for 35 days. The results showed that palpable petiole distortion appeared when R proportion was more than 70% and the distortion was aggravated with the increase of R proportion. The highest EUE and LUE were both detected in lettuce under 90%R treatment, which were respectively 3.64% and 1.20%. The least number of photons and the least electricity amount required to produce 1 g dry weight of lettuce was respectively 2.92 mol and 1.67 MJ, which were both detected in lettuce treated with 90%R. The sucrose content in lettuce treated with more than 50%R was significantly higher than those treated with less than 50%R (50%R included). Lettuce treated with 80%R possessed the highest soluble sugar content as well as the lowest crude fiber and nitrate content (not significantly different with the minimum values). R proportion exceeding 50% in mixed RB light was beneficial to the accumulation of hexose and sucrose, as well as the decomposition of nitrate in lettuce. The vitamin C content in lettuce treated with 100%R was significantly higher than that in lettuce under other treatments in the study. On the whole, the study indicated that the proportions of R and B affected the energy use efficiency and quality of lettuce in closed plant factory, however the responses of plants to the proportions of R and B varied according to different indexes. Thus, some indexes of top priority should be determined before choosing the optimal proportions of R and B.

In the greenhouse cultivation, air temperature and relative air humidity are regulated by switching on/off the evaporative systems and opening/closing the roof windows, which causes VPD fluctuation. However, it remains unclear how VPD fluctuation affects photosynthetic and growth performance in plants. Here, we examined the effects of the VPD fluctuation on the photosynthetic and growth characteristics in lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.). The parameters for gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence and biomass production were evaluated under the conditions of drastic (1.63 kPa for 6 min and 0.63 for 3 min) or moderate (1.32 kPa for 7 min and 0.86 kPa for 3 min) VPD fluctuation. The drastic VPD fluctuation induced gradual decrease in stomatal conductance and thus CO2 assimilation rate during the measurements, while moderate VPD fluctuation caused no reduction of these parameters. Furthermore, data showed moderate VPD fluctuation maintained leaf expansion and the efficiency of CO2 diffusion across leaf surface, resulting in enhanced plant growth compared with drastic VPD fluctuation.

Canopy Size and Light Use Efficiency Explain Growth Differences between Lettuce and Mizuna in Vertical Farms	PLANTS-BASEL			English	Article						canopy size; incident light; light interception; light use efficiency; mizuna; projected canopy size; quantum yield of photosystem II	RADIATION-USE EFFICIENCY; CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE; YOUNG LEAVES; INTERCEPTION; RED; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; ANTHOCYANINS; ACCLIMATION; RESPIRATION; COVERAGE	Vertical farming is increasingly popular due to high yields obtained from a small land area. However, the energy cost associated with lighting of vertical farms is high. To reduce this cost, more energy efficient (biomass/energy use) crops are required. To understand how efficiently crops use light energy to produce biomass, we determined the morphological and physiological differences between mizuna (Brassica rapa var. japonica) and lettuce (Lactuca sativa 'Green Salad Bowl'). To do so, we measured the projected canopy size (PCS, a morphological measure) of the plants throughout the growing cycle to determine the total amount of incident light the plants received. Total incident light was used together with the final dry weight to calculate the light use efficiency (LUE, g of dry weight/mol of incident light), a physiological measure. Plants were grown under six photosynthetic photon flux densities (PPFD), from 50 to 425 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), for 16 h d(-1). Mizuna and lettuce were harvested 27 and 28 days after seeding, respectively. Mizuna had greater dry weight than lettuce (p < 0.0001), especially at higher PPFDs (PPFD >= 125 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)), partly because of differences in the projected canopy size (PCS). Mizuna had greater PCS than lettuce at PPFDs >= 125 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) and therefore, the total incident light over the growing period was also greater. Mizuna also had a higher LUE than lettuce at all six PPFDs. This difference in LUE was associated with higher chlorophyll content index and higher quantum yield of photosystem II in mizuna. The combined effects of these two factors resulted in higher photosynthetic rates in mizuna than in lettuce (p = 0.01). In conclusion, the faster growth of mizuna is the result of both a larger PCS and higher LUE compared to lettuce. Understanding the basic determinants of crop growth is important when screening for rapidly growing crops and increasing the efficiency of vertical farms.

PLANTS-BASEL			English	Article						LEDs; pulsed light; chlorophyll; phenols; antiradical activity	CHLOROPHYLL; QUALITY; IRRADIATION	The effect of multicolor pulsed light-emitting diode (LED) irradiation on lettuce "Defender" growth, photosynthetic performance and antioxidant properties was studied. The experiments were designed to compare the continuous and pulsed lighting (0.5, 1 kHz; 50% duty ratio) effects of B450, G520, R660 and FR735 lighting components, maintaining total diurnal integral light quantity (DLI 14.4 mol m(-2) day(-1)) constant during the 16-h photoperiod. The results showed that lettuce grown under pulsed irradiation displayed superior growth performance, including a significant enhancement of fresh (similar to 32%) and dry biomass (similar to 36%) and leaf area (similar to 48%). Lettuce cultivated in both pulsed light treatments was characterized by the higher photosynthetic rate, chlorophyll (a,b) and carotenoid concentration. However, the total phenol and antioxidant properties in lettuce were more dependent on the specific pulsed light frequency. Only treatment with 1 kHz frequency was effective for higher phenol content, 2,20-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) free radical scavenging activity and Fe2+ reducing antioxidant power (FRAP). Thus, our results propose the role of pulsed LED light in improving the photosynthetic efficiency and antioxidative properties of lettuce plants cultivated indoors. In the future, pulsed lighting techniques should be included in the development of artificial lighting systems in controlled environment agriculture (CEA) to produce high-quality crops with the possibility to save electricity.

The shoot length increased with lower light intensity up to 75 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), and the leaf area and specific leaf weight were greatest at 100 and 75 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), respectively. Stomata frequency was higher from 100 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) with higher light intensity, and single stomatal pore length also increased at 150 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). Net photosynthetic rate at light saturation and net photosynthetic rate in growth condition increased sequentially up to 100 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) before rapidly decreasing at 150 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). The dark respiration rate and light compensation point were significantly high at 150 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) only. Fv/Fm and chlorophyll content statistically differed from 63 and 84 days after seedling stand, respectively. Thus, the leaves withered to death with higher light intensity. The ginsenoside content in the roots significantly increased according to the light intensity, and the panaxadiol/panaxatriol (PT) ratio tended to decrease as the PT-type ginsenosides increased further. Taken together, the range of 75-100 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) was found to be beneficial for growth, photosynthetic acclimation response, and total accumulated ginsenosides of ginseng seedlings.

Three-week-old seedlings were germinated and grown at 23 degrees C air temperature, 60% relative humidity, 1000 mu mol mol(-1) CO2, 200 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) (white LEDs), and a photo-period of 12 h for 3 weeks in a plant factory with artificial lighting. Plants were supplementally irradiated with different peak wavelengths of UV-A LEDs (395, 385, 375, and 365 nm) of 30 W m(-2) and UV-A lamps of 15.5 W m(-2) continuously for 7 days. Treatment with 395, 385, and 375 nm increased shoot fresh and dry weights than the control at 5 and 7 days of treatment. F-v/F-m value was significantly decreased at 12 h of all UV-A treatments and consistently showed lower levels compared to the control during the entire period. The photosynthetic rates of the 395 and 385 nm treatments were significantly higher than those of the other treatments. UV-A treatment enhanced total phenolic content and antioxidant capacity compared to those of the control after 3 days of treatment. Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase activity was also increased by UV-A light exposure. The content of pinitol, myo-inositol, and sucrose was increased by UV-A radiation, and the highest values were observed in the 395 nm treatment at 5 and 7 days of treatment. Our findings suggest that supplemental radiation of UV-A with a peak wavelength near 400 nm could increase the shoot biomass and antioxidant phenolics and sugar alcohols in ice plants.

Increased GLs have been studied under various environmental growth conditions. Pak choi (Brassica rapa subsp. chinensis) is a GL-rich vegetable. We hypothesize that long exposure to light and drought will increase the biomass of, and GL production in, pak choi. The experiment was conducted for 6 weeks. Long light exposure (20 h/day) increased, whilst drought exposure (12 h/week) decreased the plant growth. The plants exposed to a combination of drought and long light conditions showed similar growth pattern as control plants. GL production increased at week 6 in plants exposed to long light, while drought exposure had no impact on GL production, with the exception of glucoraphanin. Significant positive correlations were observed between plant growth and GL yield with accumulated light exposure time. Our findings suggest that long exposure to light can be used to increase both the biomass and GL production in pak choi.

CO2 enrichment has been shown to improve the yield of crops. Thus, this research aimed to characterize the effects of varied light intensities and CO2 enrichment on the growth, morphology, and production efficiency of tomato seedlings in indoor growing systems. Four tomato cultivars, "Florida-47 R," "Rebelski," "Maxifort," and "Shin Cheong Gang," were subjected to three different daily light integrals (DLIs) of 6.5, 9.7, and 13 mol m(-2) d(-1) with a percent photon flux ratio of 40 blue:60 red and an end-of-day far-red treatment of 5 mmol m(-2) d(-1). The plants were also subjected to three different CO2 concentrations: 448 +/- 32 (400-ambient), 1010 +/- 45 (1000), and 1568 +/- 129 (1600) mu mol mol(-1). Temperature was maintained at 24.3 degrees C +/- 0.48/16.8 degrees C +/- 1.1 (day/dark; 22.4 degrees C average) and relative humidity at 52.56 +/- 8.2%. Plant density was 1000 plants m(-2) until canopy closure. Morphological measurements were conducted daily to observe the growth response over time. In addition, data was collected to quantify the effects of each treatment. The results showed increases in growth rate with increases in the DLI and CO2 concentration. In addition, CO2 enrichment to 1000-1600 mu mol mol(-1) increased the light use efficiency (g(DM) mol(-1) (applied)) by 38-44%, and CO2 enrichment to 1600 mu mol mol(-1) did not result in any additional increase on shoot fresh mass, shoot dry mass, and stem extension. However, the net photosynthetic rate obtained with 1600 mu mol mol(-1) was 31 and 68% higher than those obtained with 1000 and 400 mu mol mol(-1), respectively. Furthermore, the comparison of the light and CO2 treatment combinations with the control (13 mol m(-2) d(-1)-400CO(2)) revealed that the plants subjected to 6.5DLI-1600CO(2), 9.7DLI-1000CO(2), and 9.7DLI-1600CO(2) treatment combinations exhibited the same growth rate as the control plants but with 25-50% less DLI. Furthermore, two treatment combinations (13.0DLI-1000CO(2) and 13.0DLI-1600CO(2)) were associated with the consumption of comparable amount of energy but increased plant growth by 24-33%.

This study was conducted to estimate the glucosinolate and anthocyanin components of kale leaves cultivated in a plant factory based on diffuse reflectance spectroscopy through regression methods. Kale was grown in a plant factory under different treatments. After specific periods of transplantation, leaf samples were collected, and reflectance spectra were measured immediately from nine different points on each leaf. The same leaf samples were freeze-dried and stored for analysis of the functional components. Regression procedures, such as principal component regression (PCR), partial least squares regression (PLSR), and stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR), were applied to relate the functional components with the spectral data. In the laboratory analysis, progoitrin and glucobrassicin, as well as cyanidin and malvidin, were found to be dominating components in glucosinolates and anthocyanins, respectively. From the overall analysis, the SMLR model showed better performance, and the identified wavelengths for estimating the glucosinolates and anthocyanins were in the early near-infrared (NIR) region. Specifically, reflectance at 742, 761, 787, 796, 805, 833, 855, 932, 947, and 1000 nm showed a strong correlation.

Broccoli microgreens were irradiated under different photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD): 30, 50, 70 and 90 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1) with red: green: blue = 1:1:1 light-emitting diodes (LEDs). The broccoli microgreens grown under 50 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1) had the highest fresh weight, dry weight, and moisture content, while the phytochemical contents were the lowest. With increasing light intensity, the chlorophyll content increased, whereas the carotenoid content decreased. The contents of soluble protein, soluble sugar, free amino acid, flavonoid, vitamin C, and glucosinolates except for progoitrin in broccoli microgreens were higher under 70 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1). Overall, 50 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1) was the optimal light intensity for enhancement of growth of broccoli microgreens, while 70 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1) was more feasible for improving the phytochemicals of broccoli microgreens in an artificial light plant factory.

Attempts have been made to reduce potassium content in vegetables and fruits; however, induced potassium deficiency has often resulted in decreased yields. Here, we investigated a new method of producing low potassium kale and present the characteristics of the resulting produce. By substituting potassium nitrate with calcium nitrate in the nutrient solution 2 weeks before harvesting, the potassium content of kale was reduced by 70% without a deterioration in yield and semblance qualities. Despite no relationships being detected between potassium deficiency and anti-oxidative properties, the total glucosinolate content, an indicator of the anti-cancer effect of cruciferous vegetables, was significantly increased by potassium deficiency in kale. This study demonstrates a novel method of producing low potassium kale for patients with renal failure, without a reduction in yield but with beneficial increase in glucosinolates.

Growing plants under protected cultivation facilitates more precise and efficient modulation of the plant microenvironment, which is essential for improving vegetable quality. Among the environmental parameters that have been researched for optimization over the past, air relative humidity has always been in the background and it is still unclear if and how it can be modulated to improve plants' quality. In this respect, two differentially pigmented (green and red) Salanova(R) cultivars (Lactuca sativa L. var. capitata) were grown under two different Vapor Pressure Deficits (VPDs; 0.69 and 1.76 kPa) in a controlled environment chamber in order to appraise possible changes in mineral and phytochemical composition and in antioxidant capacity. Growth and morpho-physiological parameters were also analyzed to better understand lettuce development and acclimation mechanisms under these two VPD regimes. Results showed that even though Salanova plants grown at low VPD (0.69 kPa) increased their biomass, area, number of leaves and enhanced Fv/Fm ratio, plants at high VPD increased the levels of phytochemicals, especially in the red cultivar. Based on these results, we have discussed the role of high VPD facilitated by controlled environment agriculture as a mild stress aimed to enhance the quality of leafy greens.

Seed Tuber under Artificial LED Light Irradiation in Plant Factory	PLANTS-BASEL			English	Article						plant growth; potato tuber yield; photosynthetic pigment; primary metabolites		Plant production in a plant factory is an innovative and smart idea to grow food anytime, anywhere, regardless of the outer environment. However, potato pre-basic seed tuber (PBST) production in a plant factory is a comparatively new initiative. Therefore, the aim of this study was to optimize the artificial LED light spectrum to produce PBST in a plant factory. Two potato varieties such as Golden king (V48) and Chungang (V41) were grown in soil substrate under different combination of artificial LED light combinations (such as red+blue+far-red, red+blue+white, blue+far-red, blue+white, red+far-red, and red+white) maintaining photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) of 100 mol m(-2)s(-1), temperature 23/15 degrees C (day/night), and relative humidity 70%. The study revealed that, overall, potato plant growth (viz.; plant height, node number, leaf number, leaf length and width, fresh and dry weight) was enhanced by the red+far red light for both potato varieties. The total seed tuber number per plant was higher in red+blue+white light for V48, and red+far-red for V41. The fresh tuber weight was the highest in the red+blue+far-red light for V48 and red+blue+white for V41. The highest accumulated photosynthetic pigment (total Chlorophyll, Chlorophyll a, b and Carotenoid) was observed in red+blue+white light for both varieties. The total carbohydrate content and total sucrose content were higher in red+blue+far red and red+far red light treatment for V48 and V41, respectively. Finally, considering all factors, it is concluded that the red+blue+white light combination is deemed to be appropriate for the potato PBST production in plant factory conditions.

However, the seed propagation of nasturtium is inefficient, and in-vitro propagation is sophisticated and high-cost. In this study, the cutting propagation method was employed to produce nasturtium seedlings. We aimed to determine the optimal conditions for cutting propagation of nasturtium seedlings by investigating the effects of node position and electric conductivity (EC) of nutrient solution on the root formation of the cuttings. Cuttings from five node positions (apical bud, 2nd node, 3rd node, 4th node, and 5th node) were subjected to water and five EC (1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0 dS m(-1)) treatments with a hydroponic cultivation system in a plant factory. Results showed that all cuttings rooted successfully within two weeks. The cuttings from the apical bud position rooted earliest and produced the most roots regardless of EC level. Cuttings from other node positions produced longer roots and heavier root fresh and dry weights than those from the apical bud position. The cuttings under EC of 1.0 dS m(-1) had the greatest root number, the longest root length, and the heaviest root fresh and dry weights regardless of node positions. The EC of 1.0 dS m(-1) is considered the best condition for nasturtium cuttings for the range of EC tested in this study, and the cuttings from all the five node positions can be used as seedling materials.

Only Extreme Fluctuations in Light Levels Reduce Lettuce Growth Under Sole Source Lighting	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE			English	Article						assimilation; chlorophyll; Lactuca sativa; light-emitting diodes; photosynthesis; photosynthetic photon flux density; variable electricity prices		The cost of providing lighting in greenhouses and plant factories can be high. In the case of variable electricity prices, providing most of the light when electricity prices are low can reduce costs. However, it is not clear how plants respond to the resulting fluctuating light levels. We hypothesized that plants that receive a constant photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) will produce more biomass than those grown under fluctuating light levels. To understand potential growth reductions caused by fluctuating light levels, we quantified the effects of fluctuating PPFD on the photosynthetic physiology, morphology, and growth of 'Little Gem' and 'Green Salad Bowl' lettuce. Plants were grown in a growth chamber with dimmable white LED bars, alternating between high and low PPFDs every 15 min. The PPFDs were similar to 400/0, 360/40, 320/80, 280/120, 240/160, and 200/200 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1), with a photoperiod of 16 h and a DLI of similar to 11.5 mol.m(-2).day(-1) in all treatments. CO2 was similar to 800 mu mol.mol(-1). Plants in the 400/0 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1) treatment had similar to 69% lower A(n),(30) (net assimilation averaged over 15 min at high and 15 min at low PPFD) than plants grown at a PPFD of 320/80 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1) (or treatments with smaller PPFD fluctuations). The low A(n),(30) in the 400/0, and to a lesser extent the 360/40 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1) treatment was caused by low net assimilation at 360 and 400 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1). Plants grown at 400/0 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1) also had fewer leaves and lower chlorophyll content compared to those in other treatments. The four treatments with the smallest PPFD fluctuations produced plants with similar numbers of leaves, chlorophyll content, specific leaf area (SLA), dry mass, and leaf area. Chlorophyll content, A(n),(30), and dry mass were positively correlated with each other. Our results show that lettuce tolerates a wide range of fluctuating PPFD without negative effects on growth and development. However, when fluctuations in PPFD are extreme (400/0 or 360/40 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1)), chlorophyll levels and A(n),(30) are low, which can explain the low poor growth in these treatments. The ability of lettuce to tolerate a wide range of fluctuating light levels suggests that PPFD can be adjusted in response to variable electricity pricing.

We measured growth parameters in 48 combinations of a PPFD of 200, 400, and 750 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) (16 h daylength), with air and root-zone temperatures of 20, 24, 28, and 32 degrees C. Lettuce (Lactuca sativa cv. Batavia Othilie) was grown for four cycles (29 days after transplanting). Eight combinations with low root-zone (20 and 24 degrees C), high air temperature (28 and 32 degrees C) and high PPFD (400 and 750 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) resulted in an excessive incidence of tip-burn and were not included in further analysis. Dry mass increased with increasing photon flux to a PPFD of 750 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). The photon conversion efficiency (both dry and fresh weight) decreased with increasing photon flux: 29, 27, and 21 g FW shoot and 1.01, 0.87, and 0.76 g DW shoot per mol incident light at 200, 400, and 750 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), respectively, averaged over all temperature combinations, following a concurrent decrease in specific leaf area (SLA). The highest efficiency was achieved at 200 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), 24 degrees C air temperature and 28 degrees C root-zone temperature: 44 g FW and 1.23 g DW per mol incident light. The effect of air temperature on fresh yield was linked to all leaf expansion processes. SLA, shoot mass allocation and water content of leaves showed the same trend for air temperature with a maximum around 24 degrees C. The effect of root temperature was less prominent with an optimum around 28 degrees C in nearly all conditions. With this combination of temperatures, market size (fresh weight shoot = 250 g) was achieved in 26, 20, and 18 days, at 200, 400, and 750 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), respectively, with a corresponding shoot dry matter content of 2.6, 3.8, and 4.2%. In conclusion, three factors determine the "optimal" PPFD: capital and operational costs of light intensity vs the value of reducing cropping time, and the market value of higher dry matter contents.

High Light Intensity Applied Shortly Before Harvest Improves Lettuce Nutritional Quality and Extends the Shelf Life	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE			English	Article						LED; lettuce; vertical farm; carbohydrates; ascorbic acid; overall visual quality; shelf life; End of Production lighting	ASCORBIC-ACID; POSTHARVEST SENESCENCE; ARABIDOPSIS-THALIANA; CELL-DEATH; STORAGE; BROCCOLI; BIOSYNTHESIS; METABOLISM; SUGAR; INCREASES	The effect of light intensity applied shortly before harvest on the nutritional quality, postharvest performance, and shelf life of loose-leaf lettuce (Lactuca sativa L. cv. Expertise RZ Salanova(R)) was investigated. Lettuce was grown either in a greenhouse with supplemental high-pressure sodium light (Experiment 1, EXP 1) or in a climate room under white LED light (Experiment 2, EXP 2). In both experiments full grown plants were transferred to a climate room for the End of Production (EoP) light treatments during the last week of cultivation. During EoP lighting plants were exposed to different intensities (0, 110, and 270 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) in EXP 1; 50, 210, and 470 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) in EXP 2) from white-red LEDs for 6 (EXP 2) or 7 days (EXP 1). Mature leaves were then harvested and stored in darkness at 10 degrees C to study the postharvest performance. Changes in dry matter content, total ascorbic acid, and carbohydrates (including glucose, fructose sucrose, and starch) levels were determined during EoP lighting and during the subsequent shelf life as indicators of lettuce nutritional quality. Quality aspects (appearance, texture, and odor) were accessed during the shelf life as indicators of postharvest performance. In both experiments, high light intensities applied in EoP lighting increased dry matter percentage and contents of ascorbic acid (AsA) and carbohydrates at harvest and these increased levels were maintained during the shelf life. Increased light intensity in EoP treatment also extended the shelf life. The levels of AsA and carbohydrates at harvest correlated positively with the subsequent shelf life, indicating that the prolonged shelf life relies on the improved energy and antioxidant status of the crop at harvest.

Extending the photoperiod by supplemental light increases biomass production but inhibits flowering in short-day plants such as Chrysanthemum morifolium. Previously, we reported that flowering in growth-chamber grown chrysanthemum with red (R) and blue (B) LED-light could also be induced in long photoperiods by applying only blue light during the last 4h of 15h long-days. This study investigates the possibility to induce flowering by extending short-days in greenhouses with 4h of blue light. Furthermore, flower induction after 4h of red light extension was tested after short-days RB-LED light in a growth-chamber and after natural solar light in a greenhouse. Plants were grown at 11h of sole source RB light (60:40) in a growth-chamber or solar light in the greenhouse (short-days). Additionally, plants were grown under long-days, which either consisted of short-days as described above extended with 4h of B or R light to long-days or of 15h continuous RB light or natural solar light. Flower initiation and normal capitulum development occurred in the blue-extended long-days in the growth-chamber after 11h of sole source RB, similarly as in short-days. However, when the blue extension was applied after 11h of full-spectrum solar light in a greenhouse, no flower initiation occurred. With red-extended long-days after 11h RB (growth-chamber) flower initiation occurred, but capitulum development was hindered. No flower initiation occurred in red-extended long-days in the greenhouse. These results indicate that multiple components of the daylight spectrum influence different phases in photoperiodic flowering in chrysanthemum in a time-dependent manner. This research shows that smart use of LED-light can open avenues for a more efficient year-round cultivation of chrysanthemum by circumventing the short-day requirement for flowering when applied in emerging vertical farm or plant factories that operate without natural solar light. In current year-round greenhouses' production, however, extension of the natural solar light during the first 11 h of the photoperiod with either red or blue sole LED light, did inhibit flowering.

Adding Far-Red to Red-Blue Light-Emitting Diode Light Promotes Yield of Lettuce at Different Planting Densities	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE			English	Article						vertical farm; LED; far-red; lettuce; light use efficiency; yield component analysis	SHADE AVOIDANCE; GROWTH; RADIATION; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; RESPONSES	The economic viability and energy use of vertical farms strongly depend on the efficiency of the use of light. Increasing far-red radiation (FR, 700-800 nm) relative to photosynthetically active radiation (PAR, 400-700 nm) may induce shade avoidance responses including stem elongation and leaf expansion, which would benefit light interception, and FR might even be photosynthetically active when used in combination with PAR. The aims of this study are to investigate the interaction between FR and planting density and to quantify the underlying components of the FR effects on growth. Lettuce (Lactuca sativa cv. Expertise RZ) was grown in a climate chamber under two FR treatments (0 or 52 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) and three planting densities (23, 37, and 51 plants m(-2)). PAR of 89% red and 11% blue was kept at 218 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). Adding FR increased plant dry weight after 4 weeks by 46-77% (largest effect at lowest planting density) and leaf area by 58-75% (largest effect at middle planting density). Radiation use efficiency (RUE: plant dry weight per unit of incident radiation, 400-800 nm) increased by 17-42% and incident light use efficiency (LUEinc: plant dry weight per unit of incident PAR, 400-700 nm) increased by 46-77% by adding FR; the largest FR effects were observed at the lowest planting density. Intercepted light use efficiency (LUEint: plant dry weight per unit of intercepted PAR) increased by adding FR (8-23%). Neither specific leaf area nor net leaf photosynthetic rate was influenced by FR. We conclude that supplemental FR increased plant biomass production mainly by faster leaf area expansion, which increased light interception. The effects of FR on plant dry weight are stronger at low than at high planting density. Additionally, an increased LUEint may contribute to the increased biomass production.

Leveraging Controlled-Environment Agriculture to Increase Key Basil Terpenoid and Phenylpropanoid Concentrations: The Effects of Radiation Intensity and CO2 Concentration on Consumer Preference	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE			English	Article						1; 8 cineole; daily light integral; eugenol; linalool; methyl chavicol; Ocimum basilicum; sensory panel	ESSENTIAL OILS; 5-PHOSPHATE SYNTHASE; AROMATIC PLANTS; SWEET BASIL; L.; EXPRESSION; GROWTH; GENE; BIOSYNTHESIS; RESPONSES	Altering the radiation intensity in controlled environments can influence volatile organic compound (VOC) biosynthetic pathways, including those of terpenoids and phenylpropanoids. In turn, the concentrations of these compounds can have a profound effect on flavor and sensory attributes. Because sweet basil (Ocimum basilicum) is a popular culinary herb, our objectives were to (1) determine the extent radiation intensity and carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration influence seedling terpenoid and phenylpropanoid concentrations; (2) determine if differences in phenylpropanoid and terpenoid concentrations influence consumer preference; and (3) characterize consumer preferences to better inform production and marketing strategies. "Nufar" sweet basil was grown with CO2 concentrations of 500 or 1,000 mu mol . mol(-1) under sole-source radiation intensities of 100, 200, 400, or 600 mu mol . m(-2) . s(-1) with a 16 h photoperiod to create daily light integrals of 6, 12, 23, and 35 mol . m(-2) . d(-1). After 2 weeks, concentrations of the terpenoids 1,8 cineole and linalool and the phenylpropanoids eugenol and methyl chavicol were quantified, and consumer sensory panel evaluations were conducted to quantify preferences. Overall, increasing radiation intensity from 100 to 600 mu mol . m(-2) . s(-1) increased 1,8 cineole, linalool, and eugenol concentrations 2. 4-, 8. 8-, and 3.3-fold, respectively, whereas CO2 concentration did not influence VOCs. Contrary to our hypothesis, increased VOC concentrations were not correlated with consumer preference. However, overall liking was correlated with aftertaste and flavor. The conclusion that consumer preference is dependent on flavor can be drawn. However, increasing VOC concentrations to increase flavor did not improve flavor preference. Many consumer sensory preference characteristics (favorable preference for aftertaste, bitterness/sweetness, color, flavor, overall liking, and texture) were correlated with basil grown under a radiation intensity of 200 mu mol . m(-2) . s(-1). This led us to determine that consumers prefer to detect the characteristic basil flavor made up of 1,8 cineole, eugenol, and linalool, which was not as prevalent in basil grown under 100 mu mol . m(-2) . s(-1), but too high in basil grown under 400 and 600 mu mol . m(-2) . s(-1), which led to lower consumer preference.

Plants under W had a significantly lower tuber yield per plant than the other treatments, although their shoot dry weights were the highest among all treatments. Potato plants under R had the highest tuber yield per plant among all treatments. The distribution of tuber yield under R showed a lower ratio of 2-20 g tubers and a higher ratio of > 20 g tubers, compared to tubers under W. Plants under R had greater leaf dry weight and slowly decreasing total leaf area compared to other treatments in the late stage of potato growth, thereby extending active tuber bulking under R. Although plants under B and RB did not significantly differ in tuber yield per plant, tuber bulking under B and RB occurred in different ways. Plants under RB advanced tuberization in the seedling stage, while tubers under B rapidly accumulated biomass in the medium stage. Plants under B had higher sucrose transport from leaves to sinks and stronger tuberization signals in tubers than those under W. Tubers under B had significantly increased levels of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase and sucrose synthase to promote starch biosynthesis, compared to tubers under W. Overall, red light increased tuber biomass accumulation, while blue light rapidly promoted tuber bulking.

This study was performed to develop a simple and rapid micropropagation method for applying to a plant factory system. In the regeneration process for the sustainable production of in vitro leaf explants, callus induction and propagation from leaf explants of P. ternata were excellent in MS medium containing 2.0 mg center dot L-1 2,4-D and 0.2 mg center dot L-1 BA. The highest number of shoots (8.8 per callus) was regenerated from calluses cultured on a medium containing 2.0 mg center dot L-1 NAA and 0.2 mg center dot L-1 KIN. The callus proliferation with subsequent plant regeneration was achieved at the same time in regeneration medium, and the year-round production of in vitro leaf explants was possible in the regeneration cycle. The direct microtuberization from in vitro whole leaf explants was also achieved through the one-step culture without medium renewal. The highest frequency of microtuber formation (93.0%) as well as the highest number of microtubers per explant (6.1) was observed by one-step culture in MS medium containing 2.0 mg center dot L-1 NAA and 0.2 mg center dot L-1 BA. Thus, the direct microtuberization from in vitro leaf explants was successfully achieved by the one-step culture protocol without medium renewal from microtuber induction to harvest. The adequately dried microtubers were well grown like an artificial seed in the pot culture containing a commercial soil. Accordingly, the in vitro microtubers through one-step culture could be commercially used as seed tubers for a plant factory system.

We applied four composite LED light treatments, 125:125:125 white, red, blue (PFU 2), 0.0:250:125 white, red, blue (PFU 3), 125:125:57 white, red, blue (PFU 4) and 125:57:125 white, red, blue (PFU 5) to evaluate light quality effects on antioxidant capacity of 0. basilicum plants. The results revealed that the composite lights of PFUs 2,3,4 and 5 were beneficial for the accumulation of flavonoids and glutathione but were not beneficial for the proanthocyanidin content; the plants subjected to the PFUs 2,3,4 and 5 treatments had a higher laccase activity and proline content and a lower malondialdehyde (MDA) content, polyphenol oxidase activity and peroxidase activity than the control plants.Analysis via high-performance liquid chromatography revealed that protocatechuic acid, gentisic acid, chlorogenic acid, syringic acid, cinnamic acid, quercetin, apigenin, kaempferol, chrysin, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, p-coumaric acid, apigenin-7-glucoside, rutin, rosmarinic acid were the major phenolic components in the O. Basilicum extracts, and sufficient composite lighting of O. basilicum plants significantly enhanced these antioxidant concentrations. Our results indicate that the use of LEDs with different light qualities to irradiate O. basilicum significantly improved the antioxidant capacity which could be a beneficial for nutrition and health benefits.

As a variable concept, vertical farming, becoming increasingly popular, can allow plant growth for local food production in the vertical sense on, e.g. facades in addition to the classical layered structure in buildings. As substrates, textile fabrics can be used as a sustainable approach in terms of reusability. In our experiment, we investigated which properties a textile should possess in order to be suitable for an application in vertical farming by the example of cress seeds. To determine the best-fitted fabric, four different textiles were mounted vertically, and were provided with controlled irrigation and illumination. Our results showed that a hairy textile surface as provided by weft-knitted plush is advantageous. There, the rooting of cress plants used in this experiment is easier and less complicated than along tightly meshed, flat surfaces, as for woven linen fabrics.

Given this background, a study was conducted to evaluate the agronomic properties and economic viability of lettuce grown vertically in the wall of building in Dhaka city, Bangladesh. Two lettuce cultivars (V1: Green wave and V2: New red fire) and three organic growing media (P1: 40% soil + 40% vermicompost + 20% coir; P2: 50% soil + 50% vermicompost; P3: 20% soil + 40% vermicompost + 40% spent mushroom compost) along with control (P0:100% soil) were used. The results revealed that plant height, leaf area, fresh weight, dry weight, and total yield of leaf lettuce were significantly increased when the green-leafed cultivar (VI) was grown in the P1 compared to all other treatments, but V2 got maximum sensory attribute scores when grown in the P1. Lettuce leaves grown in the formulated growing media (P1, P2, and P3) had higher microbial infestation whereas, a lower content occurred in the P0. The higher economic return was observed in V1P1. These results provided baseline information for further study on urban commercial vertical farming on the building walls. These demonstrate the agronomic and economic potential for vertical farming in densely populated areas but emphasize the need for optimized food safety strategies.

Stratified seeds of the cultivar 'Chunpoong' were sown into containers with different cell heights (150, 200, 250, and 300 mm) with a diameter of 50 mm, denoted as H150, H200, H250, and H300, and different cell diameters (15, 20, 30, 50, and 75 mm) with a height of 200 mm, denoted as D15, D20, D30, D50, and D75, and filled with commercial growing media. Seedlings were then grown for 20 weeks in an ebb-and-flow subirrigation system installed in a plant factory with artificial light. Fresh and dry weights, length of roots, and leaf area increased as the cell height increased up to 300 mm. Length, fresh and dry weights of both shoots and roots, root diameter, and leaf area all increased as the cell diameter increased up to 30 mm. The root diameter was not significantly different between D30 and D75, though the roots had more space to expand. A further increase in cell height and diameter beyond H200 or D30 was not effective at increasing plant growth. The roots of ginseng seedlings were long and thick in the cells with a height of 200 mm and diameter of 30 mm. As a result, a novel plug tray was developed with a height and diameter of 200 mm and 30 mm, respectively, resulting in a root volume of 141.37 mL and planting density of 1,156 seedlings/m(2) (9 cm(2)/plants).

'Green-wave') grown at three different planting densities (33, 44 and 55 plants m(-2)) were investigated. Plants were grown under a mixture of red, green and blue light (RGB; red/green/blue light intensity ratio of 2/1/1) or a mixture of red and blue light (RB; red/ blue light intensity ratio of 3/1), at 200 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) for two weeks. At 44 plants m(-2), the shoot fresh weight under ROB was significantly lower than that under RB, which was due to the decrease in the leaf number. There was no difference in the shoot fresh weight between the light treatments at 33 and 55 plants m(-2). Chlorophyll and ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase contents in the lower leaves were significantly higher under RGB than under RB conditions. These data indicated that increases in these components did not lead to improving of the growth under the RGB condition compared with the RB condition, while green light irradiation could be valuable in suppressing leaf senescence of the lower leaves of Green-wave. We evaluated green light as useful because it reduces the waste of leaf blades in the pre-shipment trimming process.

During 90 days after planting the initial propagules, the cumulative number of transplants produced from propagules with a 5 mm crown diameter (CD5) was greater than those produced from propagules with a 4 mm crown diameter (CD4) or a 6 mm crown diameter (CD6). Timescales of propagation cycles (required timescale to produce new propagules; the sum of the time from planting propagules to the emergence of runners and the time from the emergence of runners to the separation of runner plants) of first, second, and third runner plants in CD5 were 2.1 - 20.7% shorter than those in CD4 or CD6. In second and third runner plants, the time from planting propagules to emergence of runners increased as propagule crown diameter decreased; however, the time from emergence of runners to separation of a runner plant decreased as crown diameter decreased. The fluctuation of the timescales of propagation cycles with propagation generation in CD5 was smaller than those in CD4 and CD6. After separating runner plants from their propagules, the number of leaves in CD5 fluctuated less than those in CD4 and CD6. These results indicate that propagules having a 5 mm crown diameter and two leaves are appropriate for the autotrophic transplant production method of strawberry in a plant factory.

Lettuce plants of four groups were firstly cultivated with the same LDC of 16/8 h (light/dark) for fourteen days. Six days before harvest, the LDC of three groups were altered to 8/4 h (T12), 24/12 h (T36), and 32/16 h (T48), respectively. The last group had invariable photoperiod and was concerned as control (CK, 16/8 h). The results showed that T12 and T36 significantly improved while T48 reduced leaf area and shoot fresh and dry weight of lettuce compared with the CK. The plants treated with altered LDC had higher phytochemicals (soluble sugar, soluble protein, and ascorbate) and photosynthetic pigments (chlorophyll and carotenoids) contents than the CK, but the starch and nitrate contents of the CK were higher. These results suggested that the yield and nutritional quality of lettuce can be increased by changing the LDC properly in the later growth stage. But if the light-dark period was too long, it would have negative effects on the growth of lettuce. In addition, shorten the LDC at pre-harvest stage promoted better production yield and nutritional quality based on the same electricity consumption.

We investigated the growth of green perilla along with the levels of perillaldehyde, beta-carotene, lutein, and rosmarinic acid in the plant when UV-A, blue light, and far-red light were additionally irradiated with red light to confirm the control technology using LED light to produce high-quality green perilla in plant factories efficiently. Twenty-eight-day-old seedlings of green perilla cultivated under white fluorescent lamps were transplanted to a hydroponic culture apparatus. The plants were subjected to different light treatments (red, red and UV-A, red and blue, and red and far-red light) and cultivated for more than 20 days. Perillaldehyde, beta-carotene, lutein, and rosmarinic acid contents were quantified using an HPLC system during harvesting. It was observed that top fresh weight, plant height, leaf area attached to the main stem, fresh stem weight, and dry weight of leaves and stems were the highest under red plus far-red light among all light treatments. Addition of blue or far-red to red light did not affect perillaldehyde, lutein, beta-carotene, and rosmarinic acid concentrations in green perilla. Irradiation with red plus UV-A light tended to increase the carotenoid concentration and decrease the rosmarinic acid concentration in green perilla, compared with red light only. To cultivate green perilla with high rosmarinic acid concentration, irradiation with only red light is effective, and to cultivate green perilla with high carotenoid concentration, red light supplemented with UV-A is effective.

The experiments were conducted in a plant factory under a 120 mu mole.m(-2).s(-1) photosynthetic photon flux density, CO2 concentration of 1000 ppm, and daytime and nighttime temperature of 25 degrees C/18 h and 17 degrees C/6 h, respectively. The experiment results revealed that after 15 days of treatment under different spectral qualities, the appearances of the two lettuce leaves differed slightly. The fresh and dry weights of the Boston lettuce were highest under green light treatment. The fresh and dry weights of the Ziyan lettuce were higher under red and green light, and blue light helped the leaves to change color. In addition, photosynthesis analyzers were used to investigate the photosynthetic efficiency of the two types of lettuce under the four spectral qualities under the six luminous intensity levels of 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, and 120 mu mole.m(-2).s(-1) and six CO2 concentrations of 400, 600, 800, 1000, 1200, and 1400 ppm. The photosynthetic efficiency of the two types of lettuce generally increased with increasing luminous intensity and CO2 concentration. When the luminous intensity was 100 and 120 mu mole.m(-2).s-(1) and the CO2 concentration was 1200 ppm and 1400 ppm, the Boston lettuce had the highest photosynthetic efficiency under green light. When luminous intensity was 120 mu mole.m(-2).s(-1) and the CO2 concentration was over 1000 ppm, the Ziyan lettuce had the highest photosynthetic efficiency under red light. These results revealed that the monochromatic LED light most suitable for growth differed across types of lettuce. In this experiment, the yield and photosynthetic efficiency of Boston lettuce were highest under green light. Those of Ziyan lettuce were highest under red light.

CULTIVAR BENIHOPPE; DIURNAL TEMPERATURES; DRY-MATTER; TRANSLOCATION; FLOWER; FOCUS	Four cultivars of June-bearing strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa Duch.) were grown under controlled environmental conditions to determine the optimum air temperature in the light period for fruit production in a plant factory with artificial lighting. The air temperature in the dark period was set at 7 degrees C, and at 22 or 27 degrees C in the light period. Fruit were harvested continuously for 30 weeks. The fast day fruit harvested tended to be earlier at 27 degrees C than at 22 degrees C for all cultivars. The marketable fruit yield was significantly higher at 22 degrees C for 'Sachinoka' whereas it was higher at 27 degrees C for 'Tochiotome.' The soluble solid content (SSC) of the early harvested fruit was significantly higher at 22 degrees C than at 27 degrees C for all cultivars. The SSC of the late harvested fruit was significantly higher at 27 degrees C for only 'Tochiotome.' Regadless of cultivar, fruit firmness was significantly higher at 22 degrees C.

To have a healthy and productive tomato plant, a high-quality seedling is a necessity. Toward this end, the current research was to improve a system for producing tomato seedlings in plant factories using light-emitting diodes (LEDs). The results indicated that tomato seedlings of both cultivars under (Red 70% + Blue 30%) showed the greatest plant height and the largest total leaf area. The best treatment for the accumulation of soluble protein and soluble sugar contents for Gangmu No.1 and Millennium cultivars were (Red 50%+Green 20%+ Blue 30%) and Red 100%, respectively. The Non-Photochemical Quenching under (Red 50%+Green 20%+ Blue 30%) treatment was the lowest for Gangmu No.1, while it was the lowest under white fluorescent light for Millennium. The electron transport rate under white fluorescent light treatment was the highest for Gangmu No.1, while it was the highest under (Red 70% + Blue 30%) for Millennium. The results indicated that the mixture of red and blue at (Red 70% + Blue 30%) was beneficial for the growth of tomato seedlings for both cultivars, which could be efficiently used in plant factories and provide some data for different LED light ratios applicable in a closed system to demonstrate how to get the best lighting conditions for tomato seedlings.

Easily measured leaf variables will be useful to predict for the flexible adjustment of physiochemical parameters in a cultural regime in plant factory conditions. Red, green, and blue light-emitting diode (LED) spectra were used to culture victory onion sprouts. Compared to the green-light spectrum, the red-light spectrum promoted leaf width and area, specific leaf area, and dry mass, water content, fine root growth, and starch accumulation in shoots, but lowered concentrations of total flavonoids and saponins. Sprouts had their shoots cut, but there were limited interactive effects with light spectra on most variables. In general, shoot-cutting depressed growth of leaf morphology, shoot weight, water content, and soluble sugar content, but enhanced accumulation of secondary metabolites. We did not find any relationship between leaf variables and secondary metabolites. Instead, wider leaves with a larger area generally had greater dry mass, water content, and soluble sugar accumulation. Leaves with deeper green colours generally had the opposite effects.

The spectral quality control allowed by LED lighting potentially enables steering plant development toward desired phenotypes. However, this requires detailed knowledge on how light quality affects different developmental processes per plant species or even cultivar, and how well information from model plants translates to horticultural crops. Here we have grown the model dicot Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) and the crop plant Solanum lycopersicum (tomato) under white or monochromatic red or blue LED conditions. In addition, seedlings were grown in vitro in either light-grown roots (LGR) or dark-grown roots (DGR) LED conditions. Our results present an overview of phenotypic traits that are sensitive to red or blue light, which may be used as a basis for application by tomato nurseries. Our comparative analysis showed that young tomato plants were remarkably indifferent to the LED conditions, with red and blue light effects on primary growth, but not on organ formation or flowering. In contrast, Arabidopsis appeared to be highly sensitive to light quality, as dramatic differences in shoot and root elongation, organ formation, and developmental phase transitions were observed between red, blue, and white LED conditions. Our results highlight once more that growth responses to environmental conditions can differ significantly between model and crop species. Understanding the molecular basis for this difference will be important for designing lighting systems tailored for specific crops.

Producing Enhanced Yield and Nutritional Pigmentation in Lollo Rosso Through Manipulating the Irradiance, Duration, and Periodicity of LEDs in the Visible Region of Light	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE			English	Article						LED; blue light; anthocyanin; red light; diel cycle; red lettuce	RED-LIGHT; PHENOLIC-COMPOUNDS; ARTIFICIAL-LIGHT; LEAF LETTUCE; PLANT; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; GROWTH; GREEN; WHITE; BLUE	Pigmented food are an important part of the human diet, and anthocyanins have demonstrable protection against tumor production in mouse models and beneficial effects on human liver chemistry. As such, producing pigmented crops is important for a nutritionally diverse diet. Lollo rosso lettuce is a fast-growing pigmented plant, is rich in phenolic compounds, and represents a suitable system to test optimization strategies for yield and anthocyanin production. High-energy UV wavebands are often used to stimulate increased pigmentation; however, we hypothesized that optimizing visible wavebands would deliver both yield and quality improvements. Growing Lollo rosso under irradiances between 5 and 180 W m(-2) using visible waveband LEDs produced 0.4 g fresh weight per W m(-2) in the linear portion of the curve between 5 and 40 W m(-2) and achieved an approximate asymptote of 20 g fresh weight at around 100-120 W m(-2) for yield. Anthocyanin content increased linearly with irradiance. We attempted to optimize the visible wavebands by supplementing half the asymptotic energy for 15 days with supplemental red (R) or blue (B) wavebands in the peaks of photosynthetic activity (430-460 and 630-660 nm). R and B affected rosette morphology with no significant impact on yield, but B significantly increased anthocyanin content by 94% compared to R. We therefore focused on further optimizing B by shortening the daily duration of supplemental B. The minimum B treatment that lacked significant pigment induction was 1 h. We hypothesized that short durations would be more active at different times in the diurnal cycle. Supplemental B was applied for 2 h at four different times. A night-break with B produced the highest yield and anthocyanin content. Our research demonstrates new ways to efficiently use readily available LEDs within the PAR wavebands to increase both yield and crop quality in controlled environment agriculture.

Response of Basil Growth and Morphology to Light Intensity and Spectrum in a Vertical Farm	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE			English	Article						basil; LED; spectra; blue light; far-red light; photosynthetic photon flux density; vertical farming	BLUE-LIGHT; EMITTING-DIODES; PLANT-RESPONSES; SUBSTITUTING GREEN; OCIMUM-BASILICUM; SHADE-AVOIDANCE; QUANTUM YIELD; SWEET BASIL; RED-LIGHT; PHOTOSYNTHESIS	Vertical farming is becoming increasingly popular for production of leafy vegetables and herbs, with basil (Ocimum basilicum L.) as one of the most popular herbs. In basil most research has focused on increasing secondary metabolites with light spectra. However, knowledge about the effect of light intensity (photosynthetic photon flux density, PPFD) and spectra on growth and morphology is key for optimizing quality at harvest. The impact of PPFD and spectrum on plant growth and development is species dependent and currently few studies in basil are available. Understanding the response to End-Of-Production (EOP) light of growth and morphology is important for successful vertical farming. We performed a comprehensive series of experiments, where the effects of EOP PPFD, fraction of blue and their interaction on the growth and morphology were analyzed in two green and one purple basil cultivar. In addition, the impact of different EOP intensities and duration of far-red were investigated. We found that increasing the PPFD increased fresh mass, dry matter content and plant height in all three cultivars. The responses were linear or quadratic depending on the cultivar. A high fraction of blue (>90%) increased plant height and decreased the dry mass partitioning to the leaves. The only interaction found between the fraction of blue and overall PPFD was on plant height in the green cultivar whereas other growth parameters and morphology responded stronger to PPFD than to the fraction of blue light. Plant dry matter production was increased with the addition of far-red. Far-red EOP intensity treatments enhanced the fraction of dry mass partitioned to the leaves, whereas a prolonged far-red treatment enhanced partitioning to the stem. Both plant fresh mass and dry matter content were improved by applying high PPFD shortly before harvest. Light spectra were found to be of less importance than PPFD with respect to plant dry matter content. Light use efficiency (LUE) based on fresh mass decreased with increasing PPFD whereas LUE based on dry mass increased with increasing PPFD, when given as EOP treatments. The overall physiological mechanisms of the light intensity and spectral effects are discussed.	[Larsen, Dorthe N.; Woltering, Ernst J.; Marcelis, Leo F.

In order to confirm optimal irrigation schemes for the production of cucumber scions and rootstocks in a PFAL, in this study, four different start points of irrigation were applied by measuring the weight of the plug tray to compare the growth of cucumber scions and rootstocks cultivated in a PFAL. Additionally, the growth characteristics of cucumber seedlings grafted with scions and rootstocks cultivated between in a greenhouse and in a PFAL were investigated. Although the growth of cucumber scions and rootstocks was highest when irrigation was conducted at 70% of water content in a medium, the growth of grafted cucumber seedlings before and after transplanting was not significantly different among the irrigation treatments in a PFAL. However, water use efficiency (WUE) during cucumber scions and rootstock production in a PFAL was higher at 60% than at 70%. Considering seedling growth and the efficiency of irrigation such as WUE and irrigation schedule, the optimal start point of irrigation during the production of cucumber scions and rootstocks in a PFAL was determined as 60% of water content in a medium. When the optimal irrigation regime was applied to the production of cucumber scions and rootstocks in a PFAL, the morphological characteristics of cucumber scions and rootstocks cultivated in a PFAL were more suitable for grafting compared with that of the cucumber scions and rootstocks cultivated conventionally in a greenhouse. The favorable environmental conditions during the cultivation of cucumber scions and rootstocks in a PFAL also positively affected the flowering response of cucumber grafted seedlings after transplanting.

Vertical farms are located in indoor environments with artificial solar radiation, completely insulated and protected from outdoor environmental conditions. Since cultivated plant species need many hours of light daily to meet their growth requirements, energy costs are very high, which can be an inhibiting factor for the advancement of the technology. In this research study, we tested the growth rate of basil plants (Genovese species) under two lighting systems. At first, the plants were grown under 16 h of continuous light, and in the second lighting system, under a photoperiod of 14 h with intermittent light. The light intensity was stable in both treatments. The purpose was to determine if intermittent light exposure could reduce the energy consumption of basil grown in indoor environments sufficiently and efficiently without adversely affecting the growth rate and biomass production of the plants. The results of the study showed that the intermittent lighting system, in which light was emitted intermittently in short (10-min) light cycles, did not affect negatively the quality and quantity of basil plants. It was found that the short light intervals were not sufficient to attain the optimal photosynthetic efficiency of the cultivation, while the overall photosynthetic rate did not decrease significantly under the indoor conditions. Finally, the evaluation of the energy footprint under various light treatments can have a positive impact on the energetic, economic, business, and ecological phases of indoor food production.

As a widely grown vegetable in the plant factory, lettuce is responsive to light intensity. Strong or weak light will seriously affect its yield and quality. These differences can be articulated by images and then classified by fine-grained classification methods. Deep learning is commonly used in crop image classification due to its fast and convenient advantages, but conventional fine-grained recognition approaches are still extremely challenging in dealing with this kind of inter-species classification. To address this issue, this work takes lettuce as the research object and established a set of leaf images for lettuce light stress grading. The leaves were divided into four categories depending on the changes in shoot fresh weight. Then, a hierarchical fusion convolutional neural network architecture (MFC-CNN) based on multi-scale input was constructed to grade the light stress. We firstly separate leaf patches from complete leaf and construct four-scale input to expand local leaf vein and texture information.

Far-red light has been studied widely to control plant growth and development. Therefore, this study aimed to find the effect of supplemental far-red-enriched LED lights to control the growth of tomato, red pepper, cucumber, gourd, watermelon and bottle gourd seedlings. The treatments were cool white LED:far-red LED at ratios of 5:0, 5:1, 5:2 and 5:3. The growth of tomato and red pepper seedlings, including hypocotyl length, was correlated to far-red light and light intensity. The phytochrome photostationary state (PSS) value of maximum hypocotyl length by supplemental far-red-enriched light ranged from 0.69 to 0.77 in tomato and red pepper seedlings. Although hypocotyl lengths of cucumber and watermelon were greatly affected by PSS, the PSS value for maximum hypocotyl length was lower than for tomato and red pepper. These results show that manipulating supplemental far-red enrichment can be used to control vegetable seedling growth with some variation among plant species.

One-year-old ginseng seedlings were cultivated under various light treatments including: monochromatic (red (R), green (G), and blue (B)), various RB and RGB combinations, white (fluorescent lamps (FL) and natural white (NW)), and supplemental far red (FR). R and high R ratio increased growth characteristics of ginseng sprouts (excepted for root dry weight). The replacement of G for B in RGB group and W group did not increase the growth, and supplemental FR increased shoot and root fresh weights, total fresh weight, and leaf area. R had 1.5 times higher photosynthetic rate compared to B and G, and R(8)G(1)B(1) and R(9)G(1)B(0) showed the highest values in RGB group; whereas the RB, W, and FR groups did not enhance photosynthetic rate. B and high B ratio increased shoot saponin and ginsenosides, total saponin and ginsenosides contents. Total saponin content in shoot was 4.4 times higher than that in root. The supplemental FR enhanced both total saponin and ginsenosides contents. In conclusion, NW + FR showed the highest total fresh weight, saponin and ginsenosides contents among all treatments, suggesting that supplementation of FR has a positive effect on ginseng sprouts grown in plant factories.

A total of 3497 transplants were produced by the ATPM over 365 days with nine propagules in a cultivation area of 3.6 m(2) in the T-PFAL. When the simulated results were fit with the measured results, the propagation cycle timescales from planting propagules to producing the first, second, and third runner plants were 15, 27, and 43 days, respectively. The cumulative number of transplants (CNT) produced from 5, 10, and 20 initial propagules in a cultivation area of 36 m(2) over 365 days was simulated by the verified program along with the propagation cycles, and these values were 27,970, 30,010, and 31,900, respectively. The simulated CNTs from nine initial propagules in 18 and 72 m(2) over 365 days were 15,950 and 55,940, respectively. These results indicate that the ATPM is an appropriate propagation method to produce transplants rapidly in a T-PFAL, especially when the number of propagules or propagules is limited.

J	Park, YG; Jeong, BR				Park, Yoo Gyeong; Jeong, Byoung Ryong			How Supplementary or Night-Interrupting Low-Intensity Blue Light Affects the Flower Induction in Chrysanthemum, a Qualitative Short-Day Plant	PLANTS-BASEL			English	Article						blue LED; flower bud formation; number of flowers; photoperiod	RED-LIGHT; GENE-EXPRESSION; ARABIDOPSIS-THALIANA; STEM ELONGATION; EMITTING-DIODES; ACTION SPECTRA; PHYTOCHROME-B; PEPPER PLANTS; GROWTH; RESPONSES	This research examined the effects of the supplementary or night-interrupting (NI) blue (B) light supplied at a low intensity on the flowering, gene expression, and morphogenesis of chrysanthemum, a qualitative short-day plant. White (W) light-emitting diodes (LEDs) were used to provide light with a photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) of 180 mu mol center dot m(-2)center dot s(-1) during the photoperiod to grow the plants in a plant factory. The control group was constructed with plants that were exposed to a 10-h short day (SD10) treatment without any blue light. The B light in this research was used for 4 h to either (1) extend the photoperiod for plants at the end of a 9-h short day (SD) treatment as the sole light source (SD9 + 4B), (2) provide night interruption (NI) to plants in the 13-h long-day (LD) treatment (LD13 + NI - 4B), (3) provide NI to plants in the 10-h SD treatment (SD10 + NI - 4B), or (4) supplement the W LEDs at the end of a 13-h LD treatment (LD13 + 4B). Blue LEDs were used to provide the supplementary/NI light at 10 mu mol center dot m(-2)center dot s(-1) PPFD. The LD13 + NI - 4B treatment resulted in the greatest plant height, followed by LD13 + 4B. Plants in all treatments flowered. It is noteworthy that despite the fact that chrysanthemum is a qualitative SD plant, chrysanthemum plants flowered when grown in the LD13 + 4B and LD13 + NI - 4B treatments. Plants grown in the LD13 + 4B had the greatest number of flowers. Plants grown in the LD13 + 4B treatment had the highest expression levels of the cryptochrome 1, phytochrome A, and phytochrome B genes. The results of this study indicate that a 4-h supplementation of B light during the photoperiod increases flower bud formation and promotes flowering, and presents a possibility as an alternative method to using blackout curtains in LD seasons to practically induce flowering. The B light application methods to induce flowering in SD plants requires further research.

Different LEDs can be designed in accordance with the light quality and intensity requirements of different plants, allowing the regulation of plant growth and development, as well as metabolic processes. Blue and red lights have significant effects on anthocyanin metabolism in strawberry fruit, but their effects on other metabolites are unknown. Here, we studied the effects of blue and red lights on the metabolism and gene expression of strawberry using metabolomics combined with transcriptomics. A total of 33 differentially expressed metabolites (DEMs) and 501 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were isolated and identified. Among these DEMs, chlorogenic acid synthesis was upregulated by the blue light compared with the red light. Co-expression network analysis of DEMs and DEGs revealed that the expression of hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA:shikimate hydroxycinnamoyltransferase (FvHCT), the main gene in the chlorogenic acid synthetic pathway, was induced by blue light. Using multi-omics-based approach, our results suggest that different LED lights have multiple effects on strawberry fruit, with blue light able to co-upregulate chlorogenic acid synthesis and FvHCT gene expression.

Our study aimed to evaluate the physiological (i.e., JIP-test) and phytochemical response of spinach baby leaves grown with regular or mildly saline (40 mM NaCl) nutrient solution and irradiated by four light-emitting diodes (LEDs) with broad spectra. T1 (highest red and far-red, low blue) and T3 (high red, balanced blue, green and far-red) led to a better developed photosynthetic apparatus compared to T2 (red peak in 631 nm) and T4 (highest blue and green), highlighted by PIABS and its structural components: RC/ABS, phi(P0), psi(E0), and Delta V-IP. Elevated salinity only affected the latter parameter. T1 induced the maximum yield production but also the highest nitrate content which was far below the maximum level permitted by European legislation. Regardless of salinity level, T3 enhanced total phenol, chlorophyll, and carotenoid content. T2 and T4 led to inferior nutritional quality. Non-saline nutrient solution promoted the chlorophyll and carotenoid contents and the antioxidant potential, regardless of light treatment. By contrast, soluble sugar content was enhanced by saline nutrient solution. Our study shows that physiology and nutritional quality of spinach baby leaves can be manipulated by small interplays in the light spectra and salinity level.

Measurement of seed germination is an important phenotyping stage as germination impacts on the whole plant growth process. However, germination measurement has been limited to germination percentage of a seed population. Understanding of the germination time, from sowing to outbreak of the radicle from seed coat, at a single seed level is essential. How individual germination time and further plant growth are affected by its microenvironment and management factors remains elusive. Plant phenotype measurement system was developed to assess individual germination time of romaine lettuce (Lactuca sativa L. var. longifolia), using time-series two-dimensional camera images, and to analyze how microenvironment (volumetric water percent in seed tray, individual seed surface temperature and air temperature) and management factors (coated/uncoated seeds) affect the germination time for plant cohort research, emphasizing practicality in commercial cultivation. Germination experiments were conducted to demonstrate the performance of the system and its applicability for a whole plant growth process in a plant factory for commercial production and/or breeding. The developed phenotyping platform revealed the effects of microenvironment and management factors on germination time of individual seeds.

In an environmentally controlled plant factory with artificial light (PFAL), the effects of CL of different intensities and spectral qualities, emitted by R and B LEDs on growth and nutrient element content and accumulation of lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.), were conducted in three hydroponic experiments. Two treatments, normal light (12 h/12 h) and CL (24 h/0 h) in experiment 1, three CL intensities (100, 200 and 300 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1)) in experiment 2, and three CL light qualities (1R:3B, 1R:1B and 3R:1B) in experiment 3 were designed. The results showed that CL significantly increased the fresh and dry lettuce shoot biomass compared with normal light, and shoot fresh and dry biomass increased with the intensity increment of CL. In experiment 3, shoot fresh biomass was great under high R light proportion CL treatment, while dry shoot biomass remained unchanged. Both CL and CL with increased intensities promoted shoot C content and accumulation in lettuce. CL reduced N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Cu and Zn contents in lettuce shoot, while Fe and Mn contents did not change compared to NL. Moreover, CL increased Ca, Fe and Mn accumulation. 100-200 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1) CL facilitated N, P, Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn, Cu and Zn contents in shoot, but K content was not influenced compared with 300 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1). The data showed that high B light ratio (75%) facilitated C content comparison with low B ratios (50% and 25%). However, lettuce grown under 3R1B treatment had the higher C accumulation. Shoot N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn and Zn contents were higher under 1R1B treatment, and Cu content did not affected by light quality. Moreover, accumulation of N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn, Zn and Cu in shoot was higher under 1R1B treatment, while P, Ca, Mg, Mn accumulation under 3R1B treatment was the lowest. In conclusion, CL tends to reduce shoot mineral element contents due to dilution effect as shoot dry weight increases compared to NL. However, long-term (12 days) CL composed of 1R1B, 100-200 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1) tends to obtain relative higher K, Ca, Fe and Zn contents in the greater dry lettuce shoot.

Polygonum tinctorium (P. tinctorium) is an important industrial crop producing indigo blue dyes, and indican is an important substance as a precursor of indigo. Here, we report the day-length dependent responses of growth, flowering, and indican synthesis in P. tinctorium. Indigo plants were grown in a hydroponic system under artificial light conditions in a completely-controlled plant factory. The growth parameters and indican content of leaves were measured and compared. Certain growth parameters (such as fresh weight and number of leaves) under 24-h continuous irradiation were significantly higher than those under other day-length conditions. Under 12-h photoperiod conditions, the flowering rate of plants with blue LED treatment increased six-fold compared with fluorescent white light treatment, while none of the plants flowered with red LED treatment. In the leaves, the relative expression levels of Pt'IGS and Pt'BGL were significantly higher in newer leaves compared to older ones. Indican content was greatly enhanced by blue light under 24-h continuous irradiation, which was reflected by increased expression levels of Pt'IGS. These findings demonstrate that there is a new regulatory mechanism for the indican synthesis pathway through blue light signalling. Blue light provides feasible strategy for artificially regulating indican synthesis and flowering in P. tinctorium.

Increasing Growth of Lettuce and Mizuna under Sole-Source LED Lighting Using Longer Photoperiods with the Same Daily Light Integral	AGRONOMY-BASEL			English	Article						Brassica rapa var; japonica; Lactuca sativa; light-emitting diodes; leafy greens; light interception; photosynthesis; plant factory	FAR-RED LIGHT; PHOTOSYNTHETIC EFFICIENCY; PLANT-PRODUCTION; RADIATION; SYSTEM; RUBISCO; ENERGY	Light recommendations for horticultural crops often focus on the optimal daily light integral (DLI) without regard to how that light is delivered throughout each day. Because photosynthesis is more efficient at lower photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD), we hypothesized that longer photoperiods with lower PPFD results in faster growth than shorter photoperiods with higher PPFD and the same DLI. We quantified the effect of different photoperiods, all providing the same DLI, on photosynthesis and growth of two leafy greens. Mizuna (Brassica rapa var. japonica) and lettuce (Lactuca sativa) "Little Gem" were grown from seed in a controlled environment chamber (20 degrees C and 819 mu mol center dot mol(-1) CO2) under six photoperiods (10, 12, 14, 16, 18, and 20 h). LED fixtures provided white light and PPFD was adjusted so each treatment received a DLI of 16 mol center dot m(-2)center dot d(-1). Mizuna and lettuce were harvested 30 and 41 days after planting, respectively. Longer photoperiods with lower PPFD increased light interception, chlorophyll content index, quantum yield of photosystem II, and aboveground biomass, but decreased instantaneous CO2 assimilation of lettuce and mizuna. Aboveground biomass increased 16.0% in lettuce and 18.7% in mizuna in response to increasing the photoperiod from 10 to 20 h. In summary, extending the photoperiod and lowering PPFD increases growth of lettuce and mizuna by increasing light interception and the quantum yield of photosystem II.

Cultivation takes place in an enclosed structure, operating predominantly independent from external conditions in multi-layer systems equipped with artificial lighting, enabling extremely high resource use efficiencies with a simultaneous increase in yield. On the other hand, field production in terms of plant quality and harvesting times is highly influenced by environmental conditions, making it difficult to maintain homogenous raw material qualities throughout the year. To show how different light qualities affect the overall efficiency and quality of Origanum majorana grown in an indoor farm, the resource consumption, yield, and cultivation time as well as the essential oil quantity was analyzed, and the efficiencies in terms of energy and land use efficiency calculated. The experimental setup clearly demonstrated that the yield regarding fresh as well as dry matter and oil content was comparable to one square meter of open field production. Based on this, the multi-layer system and the noticeable lowered growth period result in a significantly higher area efficiency compared to the open field, leading to a potential increase of annual yields of dried leave weight and oil contents by up to 21 times. It was also shown that a white spectrum (W) showed similar influence on plant growth and yield as a spectrum consisting of blue and red (B/R). Nevertheless, the LED treatment W did show higher light use efficiencies as well as a better working conditions inside the cultivation chamber. By an integration of indoor vertical farming into existing industrial processes, new and innovative opportunities for a flexible and low-risk supply chain seem feasible and according to German food industry meet the interests of existing stakeholders.

To explore the effects of light quality on the growth and root exudates of hydroponic lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.), white LED (W, control) and four the mixtures of red (R) and blue (B) LED with different R/B light intensity ratios (R/B = 2, 2R1B; R/B = 3, 3R1B; R/B = 4, 4R1B; and R/B = 8, 8R1B) were designed. The results showed that the biomass of lettuce under 8R1B and W treatments was higher than that under other light quality treatments. The photosynthetic rate (Pn) under red and blue light was significantly higher than that of white light. Total root length, root surface area, and root volume were the highest under 8R1B. 4R1B treatment significant increased root activity by 68.6% compared with W. In addition, total organic carbon (TOC) content, TOC content/shoot dry weight, TOC content/root dry weight, and TOC content/root surface area were the highest under 4R1B. Moreover, 8R1B treatment reduced the concentration of benzoic acid and salicylic acid, and the secretion ability of benzoic acid and salicylic acid by per unit root surface area and accumulation by per unit shoot dry weight. In addition, 2R1B and 3R1B reduced the secretion ability of gallic acid and tannic acid by per unit root surface area and accumulation by per unit shoot dry weight. In conclusion, this study showed that the secretion of autotoxins could be reduced through the mediation of red and blue light composition of LEDs in a plant factory. In terms of autotoxin secretion reduction efficiency and yield performance of lettuce, 8R1B light regime is recommended for practical use.

'Zishan') in an environmentally controlled plant factory. Four treatments were set up to separate 1 h of high light into four different alternating frequencies in a 24-h light-dark cycle (16/8 h): one time (A1), three times (A3), six times (A6), and twelve times (A12). In addition, one constant light treatment with the same daily light integral (DLI, 9.8 mol m(-2) per day) as other treatments was set as the control (CK, 170 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)). The results indicated that A6 significantly reduced shoot fresh weight and increased the root-shoot ratio of lettuce compared with CK, but there was no significant difference among other treatments. Alternating light treatments did not promote the accumulation of soluble sugar, soluble protein, and phenolic substances compared with CK. Meanwhile, A12 significantly promoted the accumulation of total ascorbate (TA) in lettuce leaves compared with other treatments but decreased ascorbate/TA ratio. Above all, under the same DLI condition, alternating high and low light did not have obvious positive effects on biomass production and the accumulation of nutrient substance in lettuce under constant light was better than that under alternating light. Therefore, compared with the fluctuating radiation with the same DLI, constant radiation is a better choice for lettuce production.

To achieve greater efficiency with this system, it is essential to select lighting sources that have a suitable spectrum for runner plant propagation. This study was conducted to investigate the effects of the light spectrum of white light-emitting diodes (LEDs), which have a different correlated color temperature compared with that of white fluorescent lamps, on the growth of strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa Duch. cv. Maehyang) propagules and runner plants in a PFAL. Uniform propagules with one fixed runner each were placed into a PFAL for transplant production and were grown under either warm-white LEDs (WWL), mint-white LEDs (MWL), or cool-white fluorescent lamps (CWF) for 21 days. The propagules in the MWL treatment group had the greatest number of leaves, leaf area, top/root dry weight ratio and number of newly formed runners per propagule among the treatments. The dry weight of the newly formed runners of each propagule was also greatest after MWL treatment, whereas it was lowest after CWF treatment. However, there was no significant difference in the growth parameters of the runner plants among the three treatments. The photosynthetic photon efficacy of WWL and MWL was 5.40 mu mol s(- 1) W- 1, which was 62.6% higher than that of CWF (3.38 mu mol s(- 1) W- 1). The dry weight efficacies of the MWL, WWL, and CWF treatments were 23.5, 22.1, and 10.0 g kWh(- 1), respectively. These results indicate that MWL with high photosynthetic photon efficacy can have positive effects on the runner formation and growth of strawberry propagules and can replace cool-white fluorescent lamps in an S-PFAL.

Heavy exploration for shoots has nearly resulted in the exhaustion of the natural reserve of this species, but its traditional culture regime largely depends on land use in the long term. In this study, 1-year-old A. elata seedlings were cultured in commercial substrate under a plant factory condition where lighting was supplied by light-emitting diode (LED) panels in two bionic spectra of 16.9% red (R), 77.8% green (G), and 5.4% blue (B) (R2G4B2) and 12.5% R, 84.6% G, and 2.9% B (R2G10B1) to mimic the understory sunlight in natural populations. An artificial spectrum of 26.6% R, 59.9% G, and 13.5% B (R2G1B3) was also involved as the comparison. All LED lighting had a daily photoperiod of 18 h at the photosynthetic photon flux rate of 150 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). Seedlings were fed by exponential fertilization at the rate of 140 mg nitrogen (N) plant(-1)[N-phosphorus (P)(2)O-5-potassium (K)(2)O, 9-30-20]. Shoots were harvested twice with a midway cutting. The R2G10B1 spectrum promoted concentrations of N, P, starch, and total saponins in the secondly harvested shoots, where the R2G4B2 spectrum enhanced stem length, fresh weight, N content, and total saponin content per sprouted shoot. Total flavonoid content had a positive correlation with weight and contents of N, P and sugars, but the positive correlation of total saponins was only with weight. The drastic decline of sprout density in the second harvest decreased the content of total saponins in grouped A. elata seedlings. We conclude that light spectra and shoot cutting had a combined effect on biomass accumulation and total saponins which can be promoted in shoot-cut A. elata seedlings in the R2G4B2 spectrum under plant factory condition.

Optimal light intensity for sustainable water and energy use in indoor cultivation of lettuce and basil under red and blue LEDs	SCIENTIA HORTICULTURAE			English	Article						Photosynthetic Photon Flux Density (PPFD); Plant factory with artificial lighting (PFALs); Water Use Efficiency (WUE); Energy Use Efficiency (EUE); Light Use Efficiency (LUE); Daily Light Integral (DLI)	SALT STRESS-ADAPTATION; ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY; SWEET BASIL; HYDROPONIC LETTUCE; EMITTING-DIODES; USE EFFICIENCY; LEAF LETTUCE; QUALITY; GROWTH; YIELD	Indoor plant cultivation systems are gaining increasing popularity because of their ability to meet the needs of producing food in unfavourable climatic contexts and in urban environments, allowing high yield, high quality, and great efficiency in the use of resources such as water and nutrients. While light is one of the most important environmental factors affecting plant development and morphology, electricity costs can limit the widespread adoption of indoor plant cultivation systems at a commercial scale. LED lighting technologies for plant cultivation are also rapidly evolving, and lamps for indoor cultivation are often designed to optimize their light emissions in the photosynthetically active spectrum (i.e. red and blue), in order to reduce energetic requirements for satisfactory yield. Under these light regimens, however, little information is available in literature about minimum photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) for indoor production of leafy vegetables and herbs, while existing literature often adopts light intensities from 100 to 300 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). This study aims at defining the optimal PPFD for indoor cultivation of basil (Ocimum basilicum L.) and lettuce (Lactuca saliva L.), by linking resource use efficiency to physiological responses and biomass production under different light intensities. Basil and lettuce plants were cultivated at 24 degrees C and 450 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) CO2 under red and blue light (with red:blue ratio of 3) and a photoperiod of 16 h d(-1) of light in growth chambers using five PPFD (100, 150, 200, 250 and 300 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), resulting in daily light integrals, DLI, of 5.8, 8.6, 11.5, 14.4 and 17.3 mol m(-2) d(-1), respectively). A progressive increase of biomass production for both lettuce and basil up to a PPFD of 250 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) was observed, whereas no further yield increases were associated with higher PPFD (300 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)). Despite the highest stomatal conductance associated to a PPFD of 250 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) in lettuce and to a PPFD >= 200 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) in basil, water use efficiency was maximized under a PPFD >= 200 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) in lettuce and PPFD >= 250 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) in basil. Energy and light use efficiencies were increased under a PPFD of 200 and 250 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) in lettuce and under a PPFD of 250 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) in basil. Furthermore, in lettuce grown under 250 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) antioxidant capacity, phenolics and flavonoids were higher as compared with plants supplied with PPFD <= 150 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). Accordingly, a PPFD of 250 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) seems suitable for optimizing yield and resource use efficiency in red and blue LED lighting for indoor cultivation of lettuce and basil under the prevailing conditions of the used indoor farming set-up.

To investigate the effect of varying the spectrum on potato tuber growth and yield, potato plantlets were transplanted under red/white light (RW; red light: 200 mu mol m(-2) s(-1); white light: 100 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)), blue/white light (BW; blue light: 200 mu mol m(-2) s(-1); white light: 100 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)), and white/red/blue light (WRB; white light: 100 mu mol m(-2) s(-1); red light: 100 mu mol m(-2) s(-1); blue light: 100 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) with a 11/13-h (light/dark) photoperiod. Potato plants grown under RW had the highest mean fresh tuber weight and total yield among all treatments. Plants under RW resulted in the highest shoot dry weight at 30 d and 45 d among all treatments, providing a photosynthetic source for the tubers. Furthermore, the photosynthetic leaves under RW had a significantly higher total chlorophyll content than other treatments at 90 d. Plants under RW significantly increased tuber fresh weight per plant by 57.7% from 60 to 90 d. The spectrum of BW benefited potato bulking. Plants under BW at 40 d resulted in significant sucrose and starch changes between day and night compared with those at 20 d. BW had a positive effect on the activities of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase at 40 d and sucrose synthase at 60 d compared with RW and WRB during the day. Thus, the ratio of tuber (fresh weight of tuber >= 2.0 g) under BW was significantly higher than that under RW and WRB. The total yield of tubers under WRB was the lowest among all treatments.

To elucidate the proper light and air temperature conditions for plant growth and CPT yield, we conducted two experiments under controlled environments. In experiment 1, we measured the net photosynthetic rate (P-n) and transpiration rate (E) of the whole plant O. pumila using an open-type assimilation chamber under different photosynthetic photon flux densities (PPFDs) and air temperatures. The result showed that the combination of an air temperature of 28 degrees C and a PPFD of 100 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) was a good condition for photosynthesis and transpiration. In experiment 2, O. pumila was cultivated for 35 days under three PPFDs and three light periods at an air temperature of 28 degrees C. At a PPFD of 100 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) and a light period of 16 h, growth was accelerated by the generating the lateral shoots and branches, and total CPT content per plant was the highest among these treatments. The present study revealed that the proper PPFD and light period conditions could enhance growth and CPT accumulation of O. pumila.

'Red butter' and 'Green butter') in artificial light plant factory. EOD-FR stimulated the plant and shoot biomass of two cultivars, and EOD-B suppressed the growth of 'Red butter' but induced higher biomass in 'Green butter'. EOD lightings generated brighter, greener and yellower leaf in 'Red butter' at harvest, but the highest lightness and the deepest redness of 'Green butter' leaf were observed in the middle growth stage. 'Red butter' had prominent higher contents of chlorophylls and carotenoids, while these pigments showed less sensitivity to the interaction of cultivars and EOD lightings. EOD lightings impeded the accumulation of anthocyanin in two cultivars, except EOD-UV slightly increased the anthocyanin contents in 'Green butter'. EOD-UV strengthened the antioxidant capability of 'Green butter', but EOD lightings had different effects on the antioxidant and nutritional compound contents in two lettuce cultivars.

We investigated effects of different energy levels of UV-B radiation on growth and bioactive compounds of Crepidiastrum denticulatum. Three-week-old seedlings were grown in a plant factory for 5 weeks. Plants were subjected to different levels of UV-B (0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, and 1.25 W m(-2)), 6 h a day for 6 days. All UV-B treatments had no negative effect on the shoot dry weight; however, relatively high energy treatments (1.0 and 1.25 W m(-2)) inhibited the shoot fresh weight. UV-B light of 0.1, 0.25, and 0.5 W m(-2) did not affect total chlorophyll and H2O2 contents; however, they increased total carotenoid content. On 4 days, 0.25 W m(-2) treatment increased antioxidant capacity, total hydroxycinnamic acids (HCAs) content, and several sesquiterpenes. Treatments with 1.0 and 1.25 W m(-2) increased total carotenoid, total HCAs, and H2O2 contents, and destroyed chlorophyll pigments, reducing maximum quantum yield of photosystem II and causing visible damage to leaves. Partial least squares discrimination analysis (PLS-DA) showed that secondary metabolites were distinguishably changed according to energy levels of UV-B. The potential of 0.25 W m(-2) UV-B for the efficient production of bioactive compounds without growth inhibition in C. denticulatum was identified.

Optimal photoperiod for indoor cultivation of leafy vegetables and herbs	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Daily Light Integral (DLI); Plant Factory with Artificial Lighting (PFAL); vertical farm; Water Use Efficiency (WUE); Light Use Efficiency (LUE); Energy Use Efficiency (EUE)	DAILY LIGHT INTEGRALS; HYDROPONIC LETTUCE; PLANT-GROWTH; SWEET BASIL; YIELD; QUALITY; BLUE; RED; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; ACCUMULATION	In Vertical Farms with Artificial Lighting (VFALs), optimal light management is a crucial determinant of both economic and environmental viability. Applications of LED technologies to plant cultivation are still recent, and research has to date mainly targeted the definition of optimal spectral and light intensity features. On the other hand, despite the relevant implications on production costs, literature on optimal photoperiod management is to date limited. Indeed, the number of hours per day correlates with the total light supplied to the crop - expressed as Daily Light Integral (DLI) - and the associated energetic costs. The present study aims at defining how photoperiods of 16 h d(-1) (DLI= 14.4 mol m(-2) d(-1)), 20 h d(-1) (DLI= 18 mol m(-2) d(-1)) and 24 h d(-1) (DLI= 21.6 mol m(-2) d(-1)) of light affect growth performances and resource use efficiency in leafy vegetables and herbs, represented by lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.), basil (Ocimum basilicum L.), rocket (Eruca sativa Mill.), and chicory (Cichorium intybus L.). Plants were cultivated indoor under a red (R) and blue (B) LED light (RB=3, photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD)= 250 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)). Photoperiod variations' effects differed according to the considered plant species. In lettuce and chicory, the adoption of a DLI of 14.4 mol m(-2) d(-1) at 16 h d(-1) photoperiod resulted in a greater plants fresh biomass and leaf area, which also contributed to generally obtain higher energy use efficiency (fresh biomass per unit of electricity input), light use efficiency (dry biomass per unit of light input) and, in chicory, also water use efficiency (fresh biomass per liter of water consumed). Contrarily, although photoperiod variations did not affect basil and rocket growth parameters (e.g., fresh biomass and leaf area ) and the plant capacity to transform resources (e.g., water use efficiency and light use efficiency), energy use efficiency in basil also presented a downward trend in response to growing DLI. Accordingly, the adoption of a DLI of 14.4 mol m(-2) d(-1) at 16 h d(-1) photoperiod resulted to be the optimal option among the ones tested in the presented research.

We investigated the effect of five rhizosphere bacterial community inocula (BCI S1-5) that were collected at three open field organic farms and two soilless farms on the performance of lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.). The lettuce plants were grown in ten different plant growing media (M1-10) composed of 60% v/v peat (black peat or white peat), 20% v/v other organics (coir pith or wood fiber), 10% v/v composted materials (composted bark or green waste compost) and 10% v/v inorganic materials (perlite or sand), and one commercial plant growing medium inside a plant factory with artificial lighting. Fractional factorial design of experiments analysis revealed that the bacterial community inoculum, plant growing medium composition, and their interaction determine plant performance. The impact of bacterial amendments on the plant phenotype relied on the bacterial source. For example, S3 treatment significantly increased lettuce shoot fresh weight (+57%), lettuce head area (+29%), root fresh weight (+53%), and NO3-content (+53%), while S1 treatment significantly increased lettuce shoot dry weight (+15%), total phenolic content (+65%), and decreased NO3-content (-67%). However, the effectiveness of S3 and S1 treatment depended on plant growing medium composition. Principal component analysis revealed that shoot fresh weight, lettuce head area, root fresh weight, and shoot dry weight were the dominant parameters contributing to the variation in the interactions. The dominant treatments were S3-M8, S1-M7, S2-M4, the commercial plant growing medium, S1-M2, and S3-M10. Proper selection of plant growing medium composition is critical for the efficacy of bacterial amendments and achieving optimal plant performance inside a plant factory with artificial lighting.

Environmental control technologies are developing rapidly for improving productivity of leafy vegetables in plant factories. However, tipburn issues are also rising with the increase of plant growth rate and this reduces the product quality and its marketable value. The tip-burned parts of the vegetable must be removed manually at harvest, which causes more yield loss and labor cost. In this research, the effects of light intensities with different total light integrals (TLI) or with the same TLI on lettuce growth and tipburn occurrence were investigated. In the first experiment, three tight intensities: 85, 125, and 187 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) were applied to the rapid growth stage of romaine lettuce plants; and in the second experiment, an average light intensity of 150 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) was applied in four different lighting patterns to the plants. The results show that plant biomass clearly increased with increases of light intensity (or TLI) but was not affected by different lighting patterns under the same TLI. Leaf areas were not significantly affected by different light intensities under the present experimental conditions, indicating that plants firstly expand leaf area (rather than increase thickness) to increase light interception when light intensity is low. Tipburn occurred during 23 similar to 26 days after sowing and its occurrence was positively correlated with light intensity and relative growth rate (RGR). Regression analysis indicated that there could be a key threshold value in RGR which induces tipburn. To control an RGR value lower than the threshold value during 23 similar to 26 days after sowing would be critical for limiting tipburn occurrence.	[Xu, Wenshuo; Nguyen, D. T.

Longer Photoperiods with the Same Daily Light Integral Increase Daily Electron Transport through Photosystem II in Lettuce	PLANTS-BASEL			English	Article						photochemistry; daily photochemical integral; electron transport; quantum yield of photosystem II; chlorophyll fluorescence; photoperiod	CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; PRODUCTIVITY; EFFICIENCY; EVOLUTION; RECOVERY; ENERGY; YIELD	Controlled environment crop production recommendations often use the daily light integral (DLI) to quantify the light requirements of specific crops. Sole-source electric lighting, used in plant factories, and supplemental electric lighting, used in greenhouses, may be required to attain a specific DLI. Electric lighting is wasteful if not provided in a way that promotes efficient photochemistry. The quantum yield of photosystem II (phi(PSII)), the fraction of absorbed light used for photochemistry, decreases with increasing photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD). Thus, we hypothesized that the daily photochemical integral (DPI), the total electron transport through photosystem II (PSII) integrated over 24 h, would increase if the same DLI was provided at a lower PPFD over a longer photoperiod. To test this, phi(PSII)and the electron transport rate (ETR) of lettuce (Lactuca sativa'Green Towers') were measured in a growth chamber at DLIs of 15 and 20 mol m(-2)d(-1)over photoperiods ranging from 7 to 22 h. This resulted in PPFDs of 189 to 794 mu mol m(-2)s(-1). The phi(PSII)decreased from 0.67 to 0.28 and ETR increased from 55 to 99 mu mol m(-2)s(-1)as PPFD increased from 189 to 794 mu mol m(-2)s(-1). The DPI increased linearly as the photoperiod increased, but the magnitude of this response depended on DLI. With a 7-h photoperiod, the DPI was approximate to 2.7 mol m(-2)d(-1), regardless of DLI. However, with a 22-h photoperiod, the DPI was 4.54 mol m(-2)d(-1)with a DLI of 15 mol m(-2)d(-1)and 5.78 mol m(-2)d(-1)with a DLI of 20 mol m(-2)d(-1). Our hypothesis that DPI can be increased by providing the same DLI over longer photoperiods was confirmed.

Comparative Analysis of Horizontal and Vertical Decoupled Aquaponic Systems for Basil Production and Effect of Light Supplementation by LED	AGRONOMY-BASEL			English	Article						decoupled aquaponics; vertical farming; hydroponics; basil; artificial lighting	LETTUCE LACTUCA-SATIVA; GROWTH; YIELD; L.	Aquaponic facilities allow the joint production of fish and plants in a reduced space. This hydroponic technique, combined with vertical farming, is not well studied. The main objective of this work was to compare basil production between horizontal and vertical decoupled aquaponic systems and assess the utilization of supplemental lighting in a greenhouse environment. Six independent vertical racks were arranged with hydroponic trays at three heights. Three racks were affixed with LED lighting on the lowest levels and three with supplemental lighting on the intermediate level. Immediately adjacent to the vertical systems, two independent horizontal systems containing three trays were constructed to compare basil production. After 35 days of growth post transplanting, the total production per tray and weight, height, number of leaves, and nodes of 20 selected plants per tray were determined. Records of the intensity of illumination photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD)) were recorded at dawn (8:00), noon (12:00), and dusk (18:00) at randomly predetermined positions associated with the 20 selected plants per tray. The total basil production in the experiment was 58.79 kg, with an average production per unit area of 2.43 and 0.94 kg m(-2)for vertical and horizontal systems, respectively. Productivity per unit area in the vertical systems was 160% greater than in horizontal systems. A significant effect of lighting, the height of the tray, and plant position inside the tray was found on plant growth parameters. Optimization of light source distribution and tray orientation can enhance the productive performance in vertical aquaponic systems. Electricity cost associated with supplemental lighting per kg of production increment was 21.84 and 12.25 $ kg(-1)for the bottom and intermediate levels of the vertical system, respectively, the latter being economically the most profitable.

Hyperforin, rutin, and melatonin are the main active, and important, ingredients in St. John's wort that alleviate depression. In order to investigate the optimal conditions for accumulating these active ingredients, design of experiments and response surface methodology (RSM) was employed in this study. Two-month-old St John's wort plants were cultivated in growth chambers at varying temperatures, light intensities, and nutrient solution concentrations before analysis by HPLC, for determining differences in hyperforin, rutin, and melatonin content. The results showed that hyperforin and rutin contents were significantly influenced by temperature (18-23 degrees C) and light intensity (49-147 mu mol m(-2)s(-1)photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD)), whereas Hoagland's nutrient solution concentration (25-75%) had little effect. The accumulation of melatonin might not be influenced by cultivation conditions. Light intensity and temperature are easily controlled environmental factors in artificial cultivation, both of which are related to secondary metabolite production in the plant. Based on RSM, the optimal conditions for the accumulation of hyperforin and rutin were obtained. The maximum content of hyperforin was 5.6 mg/g, obtained at a temperature of 19 degrees C, a nutrient solution concentration of 45%, and a light intensity of 49 mu mol m(-2)s(-1)PPFD. The maximum content of rutin was 3.8 mg/g obtained at a temperature of 18 degrees C, a nutrient solution concentration of 50%, and a light intensity of 147 mu mol m(-2)s(-1)PPFD. This evaluation of suitable conditions for the accumulation of bioactive compounds in St. John's wort can be applied to plant factories on a large scale.

Lettuce (Lactuca sativaL.), as one of the model vegetables in plant factories, was grown under two light levels (G(1): 160 mu mol m(-2)s(-1), G(2): 200 mu mol m(-2)s(-1)) with different day/night temperatures (T-1: 20 +/- 1 degrees C/15 +/- 1 degrees C, T-2: 24 +/- 1 degrees C/19 +/- 1 degrees C) to investigate mutual effects of light intensity and temperature on its growth and quality properties. The results revealed that the T(2)G(2)treatment showed higher plant height, biomass and net photosynthetic rate, while T(1)G(2)resulted in decreased leaf area and lower maximum photochemical efficiency of photosystem II (Fv/Fm) compared to T(1)G(1). Simultaneous increases in light intensity and temperature based on T(1)G(1)significantly increased the contents of anthocyanin, vitamin C (Vc) and soluble protein by 58%, 21% and 172%, respectively. The higher light intensity promoted the nutritional values of lettuce, characterised by lower nitrate level and soluble protein contents. Principal component analysis showed a negative collinearity between the nitrate content and soluble protein and Vc contents. In conclusion, light intensity and temperature co-regulated the lettuce's growth and development, and their simultaneous increases better for growth and nutritional values of lettuce. These results provide a better understanding of the cultivation of plants in an artificial plant factory while maintaining yield and quality.

This study investigated the method of regulating vegetable cultivation through the interactive control of the light environment and solution ratio. A quadratic regression orthogonal model was developed to understand the role of light intensity (43 to 237 mu mol m(-2)s(-1)) and nitrogen concentration (4.3 to 23.7 mmol L-1) in lettuce growth. Dry weight, vitamin C, and nitrate contents were measured and modelled to understand the coupling effect of light intensity and nitrogen concentration on lettuce. The optimised conditions for lettuce growth were 237 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)of light intensity and 9.2 mmol L(-1)of nitrogen concentration, and these conditions were predicted to produce lettuce with an average dry biomass of 3.9 g plant(-1), 149.9 mu g g(-1)of Vitamin C, and 212.1 mu g g(-1)of nitrate content based on their respective weighting factors (0.50, 0.25, and 0.25). The lettuce yield and quality were verified using the modelled optimised growth conditions and the lettuce grown was indeed more nutritional compared to the commercially available lettuce. The findings are important for mass production of lettuce in plant factories and greenhouses.

This study aimed to investigate the physiological and biochemical responses of green and red perilla under various visible-light spectra. RESULTS Results showed that red (R) LEDs improved fresh weights of shoots and roots, plant height, internode length, node number and leaf area, as well as photosynthetic rate of green and red perilla plants compared to blue (B) LEDs and RB combined LEDs. Meanwhile, B resulted in higher stomatal conductance, transpiration rate and Fv/Fm compared to R. Supplementation of green (G) and far-red (FR) did not enhance perilla growth. Reduction or absence of B decreased leaf thickness, adaxial and abaxial epidermis, and palisade and spongy mesophyll. Total phenolic content, antioxidant capacity, rosmarinic acid content and caffeic acid content of green perilla were higher under R, R8B2 and RGB + FR, while greater values were obtained in red perilla under R. Accumulation of perillaldehyde, luteolin and apigenin presented different trends from those of rosmarinic and caffeic acids in both cultivars. CONCLUSIONS Growth and accumulation of bioactive compounds in green perilla were greater than in red perilla under similar light quality, and R LEDs or a higher R ratio in combination treatments were suitable for cultivating high-quality green and red perilla plants in closed-type plant factories.

Wheat yield potential in controlled-environment vertical farms	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						wheat; yield; vertical farm	GLOBAL FOOD DEMAND; AGRICULTURE; RESPONSES; SECURITY; GRAIN; CO2	Scaling current cereal production to a growing global population will be a challenge. Wheat supplies approximately one-fifth of the calories and protein for human diets. Vertical farming is a possible promising option for increasing future wheat production. Here we show that wheat grown on a single hectare of land in a 10-layer indoor vertical facility could produce from 700 +/- 40 t/ha (measured) to a maximum of 1,940 +/- 230 t/ha (estimated) of grain annually under optimized temperature, intensive artificial light, high CO2 levels, and a maximum attainable harvest index. Such yields would be 220 to 600 times the current world average annual wheat yield of 3.2 t/ha. Independent of climate, season, and region, indoor wheat farming could be environmentally superior, as less land area is needed along with reuse of most water, minimal use of pesticides and herbicides, and no nutrient losses. Although it is unlikely that indoor wheat farming will be economically competitive with current market prices in the near future, it could play an essential role in hedging against future climate or other unexpected disruptions to the food system. Nevertheless, maximum production potential remains to be confirmed experimentally, and further technological innovations are needed to reduce capital and energy costs in such facilities.

The hydroponic spinach plants were grown under 16 combinations of four levels of DLI (11.5, 14.4, 17.3, and 20.2 mol m(-2)day(-1)) with four light spectra: LED lamps with ratio of red light to blue light (R:B ratio) of 0.9, 1.2, and 2.2 and fluorescent lamps with R:B ratio of 1.8 as control. The results show that total fresh and dry weights, energy yield, and light energy use efficiency (LUE) of harvested spinach were higher under D17.3-L1.2 treatment compared to other treatments. The higher net photosynthetic rates were shown at DLI of 17.3 mol m(-2)day(-1) regardless of light quality. Higher vitamin C contents of spinach in all LED treatments were obtained compared with the control. L1.2 treatments with higher fraction of blue light led to more vitamin C content, lower nitrate content, and higher LUE independent of DLI. L2.2 treatment with more fraction of red light was beneficial to reduce oxalate accumulation. Power consumption based on increased total fresh weight under LED lamps with R:B ratio of 1.2 in different DLIs was over 38% lower than that under the fluorescent lamps and 1.73 kWh per 100 g FW at DLI of 17.3 mol m(-2)day(-1). In conclusion, lighting environment in DLI of 17.3 mol m(-2)day(-1)using LED lamps with R:B ratio of 1.2 is suggested for the design of a LED plant factory for hydroponic spinach production.

Twenty-eight-day-old plants were transplanted in a plant factory for 32 days. The plants were subjected to various IAA concentrations (10(-11), 10(-9), 10(-7), and 10(-5)M) from 8 days after transplanting, and the control treatment (without IAA). Shoot and root fresh weights were effectively improved under 10(-7)and 10(-9)IAA treatments. Leaf gas exchange parameters were increased under 10(-7)and 10(-9)IAA treatments. Four of the IAA treatments, except 10(-11)IAA treatment, significantly increased the rosmarinic acid (RA) concentration, as well as the tilianin concentration was significantly increased at all IAA treatments, compared with that of the control. Especially, the tilianin concentration of the 10(-11)IAA treatment was significantly (1.8 times) higher than that of the control. The IAA treatments at 10(-5)and 10(-7)significantly raised the acacetin concentrations (1.6- and 1.7-times, respectively) compared to those of the control. These results suggested that 10(-7)concentration of IAA in a nutrient solution was effective for enhancing plant growth and increasing bioactive compounds inA. rugosa, which offers an effective strategy for increasing phytochemical production in a plant factory.

Agriculture is no longer only the horizontal, traditional, and soil grown method. Urban agriculture has created ways for inner city growers to be able to farm in a restricted space. Vertical farming is the practice of growing crops, especially leafy vegetables such as lettuce, in vertically stacked layers, as this results in significantly higher plant population per unit area. Two research trials were conducted in the fall of 2018 and the spring of 2019 to determine the effect of substrate properties and fertilizers on lettuce yield to optimize the urban production of lettuce. Three substrates (P3 + CF7 = Perlite 30%: Coco fiber 70%, PB7 + C3 = Pine Bark 70%: Compost 30%, and PB9 + C1 = Pine Bark 90%: Compost 10%) along with full and half rates of a fertilizer blend (VertiGro Organics fermented molasses, Ohrstrom's Maxicrop liquid seaweed, and organic mineral blend) were evaluated on fresh and dried weight yield of lettuce. Substrate physical properties (air space, water holding capacity, total porosity, and bulk density) and substrate volumetric water content were also determined. 'Nevada' and 'Optima' lettuce varieties showed similar yield responses (fresh and dried weight) to substrate and fertilizer rates in both trials. In the fall 2018 trial, the highest fresh weight was observed in substrate PB7 + C3 with half fertilizer rate, with a mean plant weight of 41.13 g and 49.75 g for 'Optima' and 'Nevada', respectively. The least mean fresh weight was observed in half fertilizer rate of substrate P3 + CF7. For the spring 2019 trial, PB7 + C3 in half fertilizer strength gave the highest fresh weight for 'Optima' and 'Nevada' (45.64 g and 41.13 g, respectively). These values were statistically comparable to all other treatments except for substrate P3 + CF7 in full and half fertilizer which gave the least mean fresh weight. Volumetric water content in substrates P3 + CF7 recorded the highest average, while PB7 + C3 gave the least. Higher water holding capacity, total porosity, and lower airspace were observed in substrate P3 + CF7. Higher airspace was observed in PB9 + C1 but was comparable to PB7 + C3. PB7 + C3 gave the highest bulk density in both trials.

Through that, resource optimization can be achieved. To predict the plant physiological processes and implement them in control actions of interest, a reliable monitoring system and a capable control system are needed. In this paper, we focused on the option to use real-time crop monitoring for precision climate control in greenhouses. For that, we studied the processes and external factors influencing leaf net CO(2)assimilation rate (A(L), mu mol CO(2)m(-2)s(-1)) as possible variables of a plant performance indicator. While measured greenhouse environmental variables such as light, temperature, or humidity showed a direct relation betweenA(L)and light-quantum yield of photosystem II (phi(2)), we defined three objectives: (1) to explore the relationship between climate variables andA(L), as well as phi(2); (2) create a simple and reliable method for real-time prediction ofA(L)with continuously phi(2)measurements; and (3) calibrate parameters to predict chloroplast electron transport rate as input inA(L)modelling. Due to practical obstacles in measuring CO(2)gas-exchange in commercial production, we explored a method to predictA(L)by measuring phi(2)of leaves in a commercial hydroponic greenhouse tomato crop ("Pureza"). We calculatedA(L)with two different approaches based on either the negative exponential response model with simplified biochemical equations (marked as Model I) or the non-rectangular hyperbola full biochemical photosynthetic models (marked as Model II). Using Model I can only be used to predictA(L)with large uncertainty (R(2)0.64; RMSE 2.21), while using phi(2)as input to Model II could be used to improve the prediction accuracy ofA(L)(R(2)0.71; RMSE 1.98). Our results suggests that (1) phi(2)light signals can be used to predict net photosynthesis rate with high accuracy; (2) a parameterized photosynthetic electron transport rate model is suitable predicting measured electron transport rate (J) andA(L). The system can be used as decision support system (DSS) for plant and crop performance monitoring when leaf-dynamics are up-scaled to the plant or crop level.

Basil (Ocimum basilicum) 'Improved Genovese Compact' (green leaf) and 'Red Rubin' (purple leaf), green mustard 'Amara' (Brassica carinata), redmustard 'Red Giant' (Brassica juncea), green kale 'Siberian' (Brassica napus var. pabularia), and red kale 'Scarlet' (Brassica oleracea), which are high-value and multifunctional culinary herbs and leafy greens, were used to characterize the effects of red (R), blue (B), and green (G) wavelengths on plant photosynthesis, morphology, biomass production, and secondary metabolites accumulation. Light quality treatments consisted of three R and B light combinations, R88B12 (the proportions of R and B wavelengths were 88% and 12%, respectively), R76B24, and R51B49, and two white light combinations, R(44)B(12)G(44) (the proportions of R, B, and G wavelengths were 44%, 12%, and 44%, respectively) and R(35)B(24)G(41). Experiments were conducted in a walk-in growth room with a photosynthetic photon flux density set at 224 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1) and a 16-hour photoperiod. Results indicated that the net photosynthesis in purple basil and green kale were positively correlated with B proportions (BP), and that higher BP increased the relative chlorophyll concentration in purple basil and red kale. In contrast, higher BP suppressed stem elongation and leaf expansion and reduced shoot biomass in all tested species except red mustard. Higher BP increased phytochemical concentrations but decreased the total amounts of phytochemicals per plant. For all basil and brassica (Brassica sp.) cultivars, the inclusion of G wavelengths decreased shoot biomass compared with that of plants grown under R and B light combinations with similar BP. Inclusion of G wavelengths stimulated stem elongation in green basil and green mustard under 12% BP; whereas it suppressed stem elongation in purple basil, green kale, red kale, and green mustard under 24% BP. The effects on phytochemical accumulation were species-specific for the inclusion of G wavelengths. Considering biomass production, nutritional values, and working environment for growers, a white light with lower BP and G proportions is recommended for culinary herbs and Brassica leafy greens production at vertical farms.

However, light quality has only been studied in a few papers involving growth tests under monochromatic light or based on hairy root cultures. A plant factory with light-emitting diodes (LEDs) may provide high precision and standardization of ginseng seedlings for transplanting, and plant responses to light quality should be investigated for designing the optimal lighting conditions for this environment. In this study, various ratios of red light (R):blue light (B) were set from 100:0 to 0:100% at the same photosynthetic photon flux density of 75 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). As R increased, the shoot length became longer from R75B25, resulting in the single treatment of R being 1.68 times that of B. Compared to monochromatic R or B treatments, the overall growth of ginseng seedlings in R50B50 treatment increased. In the mesophyll structure, mixed light as R50B50 or while LEDs increased starch grains, and only R treatment led to dense chloroplasts in palisade and spongy parenchyma cells. Increasing R ratios had negative effects on CO(2)assimilation rate (A(N)), light-saturated net photosynthesis rate (A(sat)), and chlorophyll parameters. The higher the R ratio, the higher the ginsenoside content in leaves, while roots were less affected by spectral changes. Monochromatic R induced malformation and senescence of ginseng leaves, while the addition of 25% B was sufficient to prevent the abnormal development of leaves and dysfunctional photosynthetic operation of ginseng seedlings. The results suggest that combinations of R and B should be considered when designing artificial lighting systems for a closed-type plant factory since R affects the morphological characteristics and ginsenoside content of ginseng seedlings.

High-pressure sodium (HPS) lamps are considered not very electrically efficient as they generate high radiant heat, and as a consequence, there has been a lot of interest in replacing HPS lamps with new more efficient lighting sources in the form of light-emitting diodes (LEDs). LEDs have a linear photon output with the electrical input current, and this great feature allows the design of lighting arrays that match the plant's needs. In the current study, light spectrum absorbance of pigments extracted from 14 plant species was analyzed. Two absorbance peaks were observed in the Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) region: one at 435 nm and the other at 665 nm. The light spectrum array was designed to produce the spectrum absorbed by basil pigments. This included the use of new wavelengths of 435 +/- 5 nm to cover the blue region. Moreover, the ratio between blue and red was considered to match the absorbance of basil pigment. The use of a light spectrum that matches the plant absorbance significantly improved the investigated physiological parameters and increased the growth yield of basil. Moreover, this is the first to confirm the great positive impact of using 435 nm light spectrum in comparison with the commercially widely used 450 nm LED spectrum. This investigation has great scientific and commercial applications in the field of indoor faming and plant factory systems.

There were a total of nine treatments by three photoperiods (12 h/12 h, 15 h/9 h, and 18 h/6 h), with a combination of three NSCs (1/4, 1/2, and 3/4 NSC). The contents of photosynthetic pigment, mineral element, and nutritional quality were markedly affected by the combination of photoperiod and NSC. The highest leaf number and plant weight were found in lettuce under the combination of 18-0.25X. There was a higher content of photosynthetic pigment in treatment of 15-0.25X. Shorter photoperiod (12 h/12 h and 15 h/9 h) and NSC (1/4 and 1/2 NSC) contributed to reduced nitrate contents and higher contents of free amino acid, soluble protein, and vitamin C. Longer photoperiod and lower NSC could increase soluble sugar content. The content of total P, K, and Ca exhibited a similar trend under the combination of photoperiod and NSC, with a higher content at 3/4 NSC under different photoperiods. Lower contents of total Zn and N were found under longer photoperiod. Moreover, higher antioxidant contents, including 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), value of ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), flavonoid, polyphenol, and anthocyanin were observed under shorter photoperiod, with the peak under 12-0.50X. Generally, 12-0.50X might be the optimal treatment for the improvement of the nutritional quality of lettuce in a plant factory that produced high-quality vegetables.

Accurate and timely assessment of tomato leaf water status is a key factor in enabling appropriate irrigation, which can save nutrition solution and labor. In recent decades, hyperspectral imaging has been widely used as a nondestructive measurement method in agriculture to obtain plant biological information. The objective of this research was to establish an approach to obtain the tomato leaf water status-specifically, the relative water content (WC) and equivalent water thickness (MC)-for five different tomato cultivars in real time by using hyperspectral imaging. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and two-band vegetation index (TBI) analyses were performed on the tomato leaf raw relative reflection (RAW), the inversion-logarithm relative reflection (LOG), and the first derivative of relative reflection (DIFF) from wavelengths of 900 nm to 1700 nm. The best regression model for WC assessment was obtained by TBI regression using DIFF at wavelengths of 1410 nm and 1520 nm, and the best regression model for MC assessment was obtained by NDVI regression using RAW at wavelengths of 1300 nm and 1310 nm. Higher model performance was obtained with MC assessment than with WC assessment. The results will help improve our understanding of the relationship between hyperspectral reflectance and leaf water status.

We found that the shoot fresh weight of lettuce increased first and then decreased with the prolongation of HLI duration, whether in the early or late growth stage. On the 10th day after treatment, the root fresh weight and specific leaf weight of lettuce increased linearly with the prolongation of HLI duration, while the shoot/root ratio decreased linearly. On the 20th day after treatment, the lettuce of HL1 had the highest shoot fresh weight, leaf area, and shoot dry weight, followed by HL2. Besides, HL4 promoted the accumulation of soluble sugar, anthocyanin, flavonoid, and total phenolic simultaneously decreased the maximum quantum efficiency compared with others on the 10th day after treatment. On the 20th day after treatment, HL0.5 and HL4 stimulated the accumulation anthocyanin, flavonoid, total phenolic, and ascorbic acid compared with other treatments. The results showed that short-term HLI promotes biomass production and secondary metabolite accumulation, but HL4 caused photo-oxidative damage to lettuce. Therefore, lettuce growth and qualifies can be purposely adjusted by adopting different duration of HLI provided by red and blue light in the plant factory, also these responses depended on lettuce growth stage closely.

It accumulates camptothecin (CPT), which is used as an anti-tumor agent, in all organs. We investigated the optimal hydroponic root-zone environments for growth and CPT accumulation inO. pumilain a plant factory. In experiment 1, to determine the appropriate nutrient solution concentration (NSC),O. pumilawas cultivated using four concentrations (0.125, 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 times) of a commercial solution for 63 days after the start of treatment (DAT). The electrical conductivity of these NSCs was 0.6, 0.9, 1.5, and 2.7 dS m(-1), respectively. The total dry weights at 0.25 and 0.5 NSCs were higher than those at the other two NSCs. CPT content at 0.25 NSC was significantly higher than those at other NSCs. In experiment 2, to investigate an appropriate nutrient solution temperature (NST),O. pumilawas cultivated at four NSTs (10, 20, 26, and 35 degrees C, named as T10, T20, T26, and T36, respectively) for 35 DAT. The growth and CPT content at T20 was the highest among the treatments. Therefore, root-zone environments of 0.25 NSC and 20 degrees C of NST produced the best growth and CPT accumulation inO. pumila.

Growth Spectrum Complexity Dictates Aromatic Intensity in Coriander (Coriandrum sativum L.)	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE			English	Article						coriander; vertical farming; aroma; spectrum; light-emitting diodes; photosynthesis	TERPENOID METABOLISM; QUANTUM YIELD; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; IRRADIANCE; LEAVES; QUALITY; PLANTS; BIOSYNTHESIS; PRODUCTIVITY; ACCLIMATION	Advancements in availability and specificity of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have facilitated trait modification of high-value edible herbs and vegetables through the fine manipulation of spectra. Coriander (Coriandrum sativum L.) is a culinary herb, known for its fresh, citrusy aroma, and high economic value. Studies into the impact of light intensity and spectrum on C. sativum physiology, morphology, and aroma are limited. Using a nasal impact frequency panel, a selection of key compounds associated with the characteristic aroma of coriander was identified. Significant differences (P < 0.05) were observed in the concentration of these aromatics between plants grown in a controlled environment chamber under the same photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) but custom spectra: red (100%), blue (100%), red + blue (RB, 50% equal contribution), or red + green + blue (RGB, 35.8% red: 26.4% green: 37.8% blue) wavelengths. In general, the concentration of aromatics increased with increasing numbers of wavelengths emitted alongside selective changes, e.g., the greatest increase in coriander-defining E-(2)-decenal occurred under the RGB spectrum. This change in aroma profile was accompanied by significant differences (P < 0.05) in light saturated photosynthetic CO2 assimilation, water-use efficiency (W-i), and morphology. While plants grown under red wavelengths achieved the greatest leaf area, RB spectrum plants were shortest and had the highest leaf:shoot ratio. Therefore, this work evidences a trade-off between sellable commercial morphologies with a weaker, less desirable aroma or a less desirable morphology with more intense coriander-like aromas. When supplemental trichromatic LEDs were used in a commercial glasshouse, the majority of compounds, with the exception of linalool, also increased showing that even as a supplement additional wavelength can modify the aromatic profile increasing its complexity. Lower levels of linalool suggest these plants may be more susceptible to biotic stress such as herbivory. Finally, the concentration of coriander-defining aromatics E-(2)-decenal and E-(2)-hexenal was significantly higher in supermarket pre-packaged coriander leaves implying that concentrations of aromatics increase after excision. In summary, spectra can be used to co-manipulate aroma profile and plant form with increasing spectral complexity leading to greater aromatic complexity and intensity. We suggest that increasing spectral complexity progressively stimulates signaling pathways giving rise to valuable economic traits.

Our objective in this study was to test whether a plant's spectral perception can be quantified using the light absorption of its major photoreceptors, phytochrome, cryptochrome, and phototropin. We developed an artificial solar lamp and three different light sources, based on a high-pressure sodium lamp, a fluorescent lamp, and red and blue light-emitting diodes, whose absorption by photoreceptors was equal to that of the standard solar spectrum. Cucumber plants grown under the artificial solar and developed light sources showed normal photomorphogenesis and were indistinguishable from each other. Plants grown under unmodified commercial light sources had abnormal photomorphogenesis that made them short and small. The photosynthetic rate was higher under the unmodified light sources; however, dry masses were highest under the artificial solar and modified light sources, indicating that the cucumber plants are optimized to the solar spectrum. Our results clearly demonstrate that the spectral perceptions of plants can be quantified using the light absorption of their photoreceptors, not visual color or spectra. We expect that our findings will contribute to a better understanding of plant perceptions of and responses to light quality, and improve the productivity of plants cultivated under artificial light.

To find the optimal combination of light wavelengths for lettuce (Lactuca sativa cv. 'Tiberius') plant growth in a PFAL, four treatments, each using red (R; 662 nm) and blue light (B; 447 nm) with a ratio of 4:1 and photon flux density (PFD) of 150 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1) , and mixing, respectively, with 50 mu mol.m(-2).S-1 of green light (G; 525 nm; RBG), yellow light (Y; 592 nm; RBY), orange light (O; 605 nm; RBO) and far-red light (FR; 742 nm; RBFR), were set up during this experiment. A combination of R and B with a ratio of 4:1 and PFD of 200 mu mol(-2).s(-1) was set as the control (RB). The responses of lettuce growth, morphology, anatomical structure of the lettuce leaf, photosynthetic performance, lettuce nutritional quality, and energy use efficiency were investigated. The results showed that RBG, RBO, and RBFR increased the shoot fresh weight of lettuce by 20.5%, 19.6%, and 40.4%, and they increased the shoot dry weight of lettuce by 24.2%, 13.4%, and 45.2%, respectively, compared with those under RB. The P-n under RBY was significantly lower than that under RB, although no significant differences in chlorophyll or carotenoid content were found between RBY and RB. RBG increased the lettuce leaf area, the thickness of the leaf palisade tissue, P-n, and light use efficiency compared with those under RB. Plants grown under RBO showed better photosynthetic capacity, such as higher P-n,P-Phi(PSII), and other photosynthetic parameters. RBFR caused an increase in lettuce leaf area and energy use efficiency, but a decrease in leaf thickness and P-n of the single leaf. Moreover, tipburn injury was observed under RBFR. Therefore, these results demonstrate that RBG and RBO can be considered optimal combinations of light wavelengths for lettuce growth in a PFAL in this experiment, although plant growth can also be improved by using RBFR.

Since a number of these are phytochemicals with enhancing effects on human health, we examined the effects of 4 root-zone temperature (RZT) treatments (10, 20, 28, and 36 degrees C) on plant growth and the main bioactive compound concentrations in each organ of Agastache rugosa plants. We aimed to determine the optimal RZT treatment to increase bioactive compound concentrations with no deleterious effects on plant growth. Four-week-old seedlings were grown in a plant factory for 32 days. Nine plant growth parameters, namely, shoot and root fresh weights, stem and root lengths, leaf length and leaf width, leaf area, and shoot and root dry weights were significantly decreased at 10 and 36 degrees C compared with other treatments. A similar pattern was observed for the chlorophyll content and leaf gas exchange parameters. Of all the RZT treatments, RZT at 28 degrees C produced the significantly greatest accumulation of two major bioactive compounds, namely, rosmarinic acid (RA) and tilianin contents per the A. rugosa plant, and had no adverse effects on the overall growth of A. rugosa. This supports the use of 28 degrees C RZT to successfully improve the bioactive compounds with no adverse influence on plant growth or yield.

This study was to determine the optimum light spectrum, light intensity and photoperiod that enhanced growth and nutritional values of amaranth microgreens by using light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Two amaranth cultivars, red amaranth and leafy vegetable amaranth, were cultured for 8 days under different light spectra, light intensities and photoperiods provided by LEDs. Three consecutive experiments in the split-plot design were conducted by which, for each experiment, light treatment was a main-plot factor and amaranth cultivar was a sub-plot factor. The first experiment, amaranth microgreens were irradiated by different light spectra: red, blue, red plus blue (70R:30B) and white with photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) of 130 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). The second experiment, the plants were illuminated under various light intensities: 130, 180, 230, 280 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) PPFD with red plus blue (70R:30B) spectrum. The third experiment, the microgreens were treated with different photoperiods: 8, 12, 16, 20h (h) under red plus blue (70R:30B) spectrum and 280 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) PPFD. The results indicated that red plus blue (70R:30B) spectrum, 280 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) PPFD and 16 h photoperiod enhanced the fresh yield, chlorophyll a, b, total carotenoids, anthocyanin, and vitamin C contents and total antioxidant capacity for both red amaranth and leafy vegetable amaranth microgreens. The cultivar differences in the responses to light spectra and photoperiods were found.

Using light emitting diodes (LEDs), customized spectra can be created, including spectrum that simulates solar light. The aim of this study was to assess the growth, development, and phytochemical content at three marketable stages of lettuce (transplant, baby-leaf, and head-lettuce) under a sun-simulated spectrum and common light spectra used in indoor growing systems. Oakleaf red (Salanova (R) 'Red Oakleaf) and green (Salanova (R) 'Green Oakleaf) lettuce were grown under seven spectra. A sun-simulated light treatment (SUN) was created with 5% ultraviolet-A (UV-A), 20 % blue (B), 26 % green (G), 26 % red (R), and 23 % far-red (FR) light as percent photon flux density (PFD). In addition, five treatments of differing blue:red (B:R) ratios were evaluated: OB:100R (100R), 20B:80R, 50B:50R, 80B:20R, and 100B:OR (100B) and fluorescent white light was used as a control (6500 K). Plants were provided with 200 +/- 0.7 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1) biologically active radiation (300-800 nm) for 18 h and grown at 20.0 +/- 0.2 'C temperature. Fresh mass of lettuce in the SUN treatment was not significantly different when compared to B:R light treatments in all harvest dates despite the 36 % greater photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) in B:R treatments. Plant dry mass on day 17 of' Green Oakleaf and 'Red Oakleaf grown under 20B:80R was 15-39 % greater than those grown in 100B and SUN. When calculating total dry mass accumulation to cumulative yield photon flux density (YPFD), plants in SUN treatment accumulated the same dry mass per YPFD input (mg mol(-1)). Leaf area at day 42 of plants in 100B, SUN, and FL was 39-78 % greater than plants in B:R treatments. At final harvest (day 42), plant stem length in SUN was 2.1-4.4 times longer than in all other treatments, indicating bolting and flowering initiation. Both total phenolic and anthocyanin concentrations were greater in the B:R treatments than in SUN, 100R, and 100B treatments. This study presents baseline information for lettuce responses under LED-simulated SUN spectrum when compared to common B:R treatments and offers insights on lettuce growth and morphology under different spectra at multiple growth stages.

However, different parameters of light intensity, quality, and photoperiod will influence the growth and accumulation of bio-compounds in plants. In order to find the optimal setting of LED light for spinach planting, four group experiments were designed using the orthogonal testing method. According to the experimental results, for growth indexes including fresh weight, dry weight, root length and so on, photoperiod is the most influential factor, light intensity is the second, and light quality is the least. The best light mode (R:B = 4:1, photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) = 100 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1) and 13/11 h) among all eight possible combinations in the range was also determined. Furthermore, for quality indexes, including the soluble sugar content, protein content and so on, a new scoring method was introduced to make a comprehensive score for evaluating. Then, the light combination (R:B = 4:1, PPFD = 150 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1) and 9/15 h) in the range was found as the optimal scheme for spinach quality under those parameters. As there is trade-off between the optimal light parameters for growth and quality, it is necessary to achieve a balance between yield and quality of the plant during production. If farmers want to harvest spinach with larger leaf area and higher yield, they need to pay attention to the adjustment of the photoperiod and use a lower light intensity and a longer lighting time. If they do not mind the yield of the vegetable but want to improve the taste and nutrition of spinach products, they should pay more attention to the light intensity and use a higher light intensity and a shorter lighting time.

A plant factory with artificial lighting enables the application or suppression of stress conditions to plants for producing high-quality vegetables. This study aimed to determine a suitable root-zone temperature (RZT) treatment for enhancing the biomass and secondary metabolite content of hydroponic coriander plants. The combination of a mid-RZT (25 degrees C) pre-treatment with low (15 degrees C or 20 degrees C) or high (30 degrees C or 35 degrees C) RZT for a short period (3 or 6 days) was applied to the plants before harvesting. The fresh weights of the coriander plants were reduced under RZT stress. By contrast, the content of secondary metabolites, including ascorbic acid, carotenoids, phenolic compounds, chlorogenic acid, and the antioxidant capacity of the plants were enhanced by the combination of the lowest or highest RZT (15 degrees C or 35 degrees C) and the longer stress period (6 days). Growing coriander under an RZT of 30 degrees C for 6 days can produce large amounts of bioactive compounds and water, whereas growing coriander at an RZT of 15 degrees C for 6 days can produce high dry biomass and secondary metabolite content.

Pak & Kawano	AGRONOMY-BASEL			English	Article						antioxidant capacity; bioactive compounds; growth; hydroxycinnamic acids; hydroponics	HYDROXYCINNAMIC ACIDS; ABIOTIC STRESS; DROUGHT; ACCUMULATION; TOLERANCE; RESPONSES; LEAVES	The effects of substrate water content on the growth and content of bioactive compounds in Crepidiastrum denticulatum were evaluated. Three-week-old seedlings were subjected to four levels of substrate water content (20%, 30%, 45% and 60%) and maintained for 5 weeks. Growth parameters at 5 weeks of transplanting were significantly higher with the 45% substrate water content treatment than with the other treatments. In addition, photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance and transpiration rate increased significantly and the highest sap flow rate during the day was observed in 45% substrate water content. Total phenolic content and antioxidant capacity per shoot increased significantly with substrate water content, increasing from 20% to 45% and decreased again at 60%. Antioxidant capacity and total hydroxycinnamic acids (HCAs) content per unit dry weight of plants under the 60% treatment were significantly higher than those under the 45% treatment; however, their content per shoot was the highest under the 45% treatment. Thus, 45% substrate water content is a suitable condition for the growth of C. denticulatum and had positive effects on phenolic content, antioxidant capacity, and HCAs content. These results could be useful for the mass production of high-quality C. denticulatum in greenhouses or plant factories capable of controlling the water content of the root zone.

In this study, we investigated the effect of light quality on C. denticulatum growth, with the goal of improving the species' biomass and bioactive compound content when grown in plant factories with artificial lighting. Three-week-old seedlings were grown for 6 weeks in a plant factory under fluorescent lamps (control) and various sets of light-emitting diodes (LEDs): three monochromatic [red (R), green (G), and blue (B)], several dichromatic RB with different ratios of R and B [R:B = 6:4 (R6B4), 7:3 (R7B3), 8:2 (R8B2), and 9:1 (R9B1)], and several trichromatic RGB [R:G:B = 5:1:4 (R5G1B4), 6:1:3 (R6G1B3), 7:1:2 (R7G1B2), 8:1:1 (R8G1B1), and 9:1:0 (R9G1B0)]. Shoot biomass (fresh weight), leaf area, leaf shape index, and water content of the shoot were significantly higher in the RGB group than in the monochromatic and RB groups. Increasing the percentage of R light improved shoot growth in the presence of G light, as in the RGB group, and this was accompanied by a high photosynthetic rate, light absorbance rate, and electron transport rate. The contents of total phenolics and hydroxycinnamic acids per unit dry weight did not differ between plants subjected to the different light quality treatments, and the contents per shoot were thus positively associated with shoot biomass. Overall, R8G1B1 was the most effective treatment for increasing shoot biomass and the accumulation of bioactive compounds; the shoot fresh weight and total hydroxycinnamic content of R8G1B1 were significantly higher, by 50 % and 60 %, respectively, than those of the control. Thus, light quality affects the biosynthesis of bioactive compounds and the shoot biomass of C. denticulatum.

However, plants grown under natural environment are used to utilizing broad-wide spectrum by long-term evolution. In order to examine the effects of addition light added in red plus blue LEDs or white LEDs, green and purple leaf lettuces (Lactuca sativa L. cv. Lvdie and Ziya) were hydroponically cultivated for 20 days under white LEDs, white plus red LEDs, red plus blue LEDs, and red plus blue LEDs supplemented with ultraviolet, green or far-red light, respectively. The results indicated that the addition of far-red light in red plus blue LEDs increased leaf fresh and dry weights of green leaf lettuce by 28% and 34%, respectively. Addition of ultraviolet light did not induce any differences in growth and energy use efficiency in both lettuce cultivars, while supplementing green light with red plus blue LEDs reduced the vitamin C content of green leaf lettuce by 44% and anthocyanin content of purple leaf lettuce by 30% compared with red plus blue LEDs, respectively. Spectral absorbencies of purple leaf lettuce grown under red plus blue LEDs supplemented with green light were lower in green light region compared with those grown under red plus blue LEDs, which was associated with anthocyanin contents. White plus red LEDs significantly increased leaf fresh and dry weights of purple leaf lettuce by 25%, and no significant differences were observed in vitamin C and nitrate contents compared with white LEDs. Fresh weight, light and electrical energy use efficiencies of hydroponic green and purple leaf lettuces grown under white plus red LEDs were higher or no significant differences compared with those grown under red plus blue LEDs. In conclusion, white plus red LEDs were suggested to substitute for red plus blue LEDs in hydroponic lettuce (cv. Lvdie and Ziya) production in plant factories with artificial lighting.

The objectives of this study were to investigate antioxidant accumulation under drought stress alone, or in combination with UV-B radiation near harvest, and to determine an optimal treatment time for maximum antioxidant production. Kale (Brassica oleracea L. var. acephala) plants were grown in a plant factory and harvested at 42 days after transplanting. The single and combination treatments lasted for 7 to 1 days and 4 to 2 days before harvest, respectively. The results of both F-v/F-m (maximal photochemical efficiency in photosystem II) and leaf water potential could ensure the function of photosynthesis and maintain normal leaf moisture in single drought treatments of less than 4 days. The total phenolic and flavonoid contents and antioxidant activities were significantly increased in both single and combination treatments for 3 to 4 days, compared to other treatments. The supplementary UV-B treatments showed no extra formation of antioxidants compared to the single drought treatments. As a result, drought for 3 days before harvest could achieve the highest potential value of kale as a source of natural antioxidants.

The total 12 treatments which contained the combination of four light intensity (150, 250, 350 and 450 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1)) and three nutrient solution concentration (NSC) (1/4, 1/2, 3/4 strength NSC) were established for investigation of lettuce growth and quality in a growth chamber. The combination of light intensity and NSC exhibited significant effects on photosynthetic pigment, nutritional quality, mineral content and antioxidant capacity. That a higher light intensity were readily accessible to higher chlorophyll a/b showed in lettuce of treatment of 350 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1)x3/4NSC and 450 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1)x1/4NSC. Lower total N contents, higher content of soluble protein, vitamin C, soluble sugar and free amino acid exhibited in lettuce under treatment of 250 and 350 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1)x1/4NSC or 3/4NSC. With increasing NSC and LED irradiance, the content of total P and K in lettuce increased and decreased, respectively. The highest and lowest total Ca content were found in treatment of 150 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1)x1/4NSC and 450 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1)x1/4NSC, respectively, and higher content of total Mg and Zn was observed under 250 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)x1/4NSC and 150 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1)x3/4NSC, respectively. The antioxidant contents generally decreased with increasing NSC level. The higher antioxidant content and capacity occurred in lettuce of 350 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1)x1/4NSC treatment. The interaction of 350 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1)x1/4NSC might be the optimal condition for lettuce growth in plant factory.

However, once transferred to the greenhouse, the photosynthetic acclimation of these young plants might depend on this initial light regime. To obtain insight about this acclimatization, Chrysanthemum (sun species) and Spathiphyllum (shade species) were preconditioned in growth chambers for 4 weeks under four light qualities: blue (B), red (R), red/blue (RB, 60% R) and white (W) at 100 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). Monochromatic light (R and B) limited leaf development of both species, which resulted in a lower leaf mass per area when compared to multispectral light (RB for Chrysanthemum, RB and W for Spathiphyllum). R-developed leaves had a lower photosynthetic efficiency in both species. After the light quality pretreatment, plants were transferred to the greenhouse with high-intensity natural light conditions. On the first day of transfer, R and B preconditioned leaves of both species had an inhibited photosynthesis. After 1 week in natural light condition, rapid light curve parameters of Chrysanthemum leaves that developed under B acclimated to sunlight had a similar level than RB-developed leaves unlike R-leaves. Spathiphyllum leaves showed a decrease in maximum electron transport rate and this was most pronounced for the R pretreatment. After 1 month, R-preconditioned Chrysanthemum had the lowest dry mass, while no effects on the dry weight of Spathiphyllum with respect to the pretreatments were observed. Light quality during preconditioning affected the leaf ability to acclimate to natural high light intensities in greenhouse environment.

The MFS had seven fans which were installed on both the front and back sides of culture beds to generate airflow from two opposite horizontal directions. The fans that push the air into the culture bed were air inlets while those that pull the air out of the culture bed were air outlets. In this study, three airflow patterns were evaluated: T-1, the front and back sides of the culture bed were air inlets; T-2, the front side was an air inlet and the backside was an air outlet; and T-3, both the front and back sides were air outlets. A culture bed with no MFS was used as a control (T-4). Lettuce growth and tipburn occurrence were evaluated and leaf boundary layer resistance (1/g(bv)), sensible heat flux (S-h), and latent heat flux (L-h) of lettuce plants were estimated. The airflow pattern in T-1 improved the air velocity (V-a) by an average of 0.75 m s(-1) and a variation coefficient of 65%. The 1/g(bv), decreased significantly with the increase in V-a, and the lowest value of 54.0 s m(-1) was observed in T-1. The low resistance to heat and moisture transfer enhanced the Sh and Lh of lettuce plants. The average S-h and L-h were 40% and 46% higher in T-1 compared with those in T-4. The fresh and dry weights of lettuce plants in T-1 were 1.13 and 1.06 higher than those in T-4, respectively. No tipburn occurrence was observed in lettuce plants grown under the MFS while five leaves per plant were injured with tipburn in T-4. The results indicated that improving the airflow can improve the growth of indoor cultured lettuce and alleviate the occurrence of tipburn due to the decrease in the 1/g(bv) and the increase in the transpiration rate.

However, higher energy demands in urban plant factories are among the key challenges that need to be addressed. Artificial lighting is responsible for the most significant levels of energy consumption in plant factories; therefore, lighting systems must be modulated in consideration of the sustainable food-energy nexus. In this context, low light irradiation using blue (B) and red (R) LED was applied in a plant factory for the growth of red leaf lettuce (Lactuca sativa L. var Lollo rosso) to evaluate the growth performance and functional quality. The tested B (450 nm) and R (660 nm) light ratios were B/R = 5:1; 3:1; 1:1; 1:3, and 1:5, with a photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) of 90 +/- 3 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). In the plant factory, the photoperiod, temperature, RH, and CO2 conditions were 16 h d(-1), 20 +/- 0.5 degrees C, 65% +/- 5%, and 360 +/- 10 mu L L-1, respectively. The lettuce was harvested 10 and 20 days after the commencement of LED light treatment (DAT). In this study, normal photosynthetic activity and good visual quality of the lettuce were observed. The results show that a higher fraction of R (B/R = 1:5) significantly increased plant growth parameters such as plant height, leaf area, specific leaf area, plant fresh and dry weight, and carbohydrate content. By contrast, a higher fraction of B (B/R = 5:1) significantly increased the photosynthetic parameters and contents of pigment and phenolic compounds. The rate of photosynthetic performance, carbohydrates (except starch), and content of phenolic compounds were highest after 10 DAT, whereas the pigment contents did not significantly differ at the different growth stages. It is concluded that high R fractions favor plant growth and carbohydrate content, while high B fractions favor photosynthetic performance and the accumulation of pigments and phenolic compounds in red leaf lettuce under limited lighting conditions. This study will help in designing artificial lighting conditions for plant factory production to reduce energy demands.

We examined the effects of light intensity and photoperiod combinations on growth, total phenolic content, antioxidant capacity, and light use efficiency of lettuce (Lactuca sativa 'Cheongchima') in a plant factory employing EEFLs. Two-week-old seedlings were grown for 3 weeks at a photosynthetic photon flux density of 150 (150P) or 200 (200P) mu mol.m(-2).s(-1) under 12, 16, 20, or 24 h photoperiods. The air temperature was maintained at 20 +/- 2 degrees C and Yamazaki nutrient solution was supplied using a deep flow technique. Fresh shoot and root weights increased as photoperiod was extended, becoming greatest under the 150P/24 h condition. The shoot/root ratio was lowest at the 24 h photoperiod under 150P and 200P conditions. Leaf length decreased at longer photoperiods, but leaf width and number was increased; therefore, leaf shape became broader under longer photoperiods. Leaf area increased at the 150P/20 h condition but decreased at the 200P/24 h condition. Specific leaf weight (thickness) increased significantly as photoperiod was extended irrespective of light intensity and became greater under 200P than 150P. Total phenolic content and antioxidant capacity increased continuously with increasing photoperiods under 150P; however, in the 200P treatment, both increased up to 20 h, then decreased under the 24 h photoperiod. Light use efficiency was generally higher under 150P, but became similar at either light intensity under the 24 h period. Considering the growth rate, leaf size, antioxidant capacity, and cropping cycle, the 150P/20 h condition was deemed to be the most efficient and economical for growth of 'Cheongchima' lettuce in a plant factory system.

This study investigated the growth characteristics and glucosinolate (GSL) levels of Chinese kale (Brassica oleracea var. alboglabra Bailey 'Jellujon') cultured within a plant factory using different concentrations of ammonium sulfate [(NH4)(2)SO4] and four different light-emitting diode (LED) combinations. In total, 16 combinations of the four (NH4)(2)SO4 concentrations and four LED light sources exerted significantly different effects on plant width, plant height, leaf length, leaf thickness, chlorophyll content, and the number of leaves. For the ratio combination of LED colors using blue light (B), red light (R), and white right (W), B0:R5:W5 showed the best growth characteristics, except for chlorophyll content. The leaf fresh weight (LFW) of Chinese kale did not change significantly with LED treatments, but varied significantly with (NH4)(2)SO4 treatments. S2 and S3 treatments among the (NH4)(2)SO4 treatments resulted in the largest increases in LFW under B0:R5:W5. Six major GSLs were identified, including as sinigrin (SIN), glucobrassicin, gluconapin, 4-OH glucobrassicin, 4-methoxy glucobrasscin, and neoglucobrasscin. The highest total GSL content was achieved with the combination of B0:R5 :W5 and S4, but no significant difference was found among the (NH4)(2)SO4 treatments. For LEDs, B0:R5 :W5 produced the highest total GSL levels. SIN was the dominant GSL under the combination of B0:R5 :W5 and S4. In conclusion, the combination of S4 and B0:R5 :W5 was the most suitable for increasing total GSLs and SIN.

There were four LED combinations using three colors [Blue (B):Red (R):White (W) ratio = 0:1:9, 0:1:12, 0:5:5, and 2:3:5). The environmental conditions in the plant factory were maintained at 22.5 +/- 2.5 degrees C and 80 +/- 5% relative humidity. Sweet basil plants were grown in the plant factory at 3 weeks after sowing. The four combinations of LED light sources exerted a significant effect on total fresh weight (FW), shoot FW, and root FW but no effect on plant height and number of leaves. The B0:R5:W5 treatment resulted in the largest increases in both total FW and shoot FW. Both plant height and number of leaves did not change significantly with LED treatments but showed the best average growth using B0:R5:W5. The three major polyphenols were identified as rosmarinic acid, chicoric acid, and caffeic acid. Rosmarinic acid content accounted for the highest percentage of the polyphenols and was followed by chicoric and caffeic acids. The highest contents of rosmarinic and chicoric acids were achieved with B2:R3 :W5, but no significant difference in caffeic acid was found among the four LED conditions. Furthermore, B2 :R3 :W5 resulted in the highest yield of essential oil extracted from 50 g freeze-dried leaves of sweet basil, followed by B0:R5:W5, B0:R1:R12, and B0:R1:W9. Methyl-cinnamate content accounted for the highest percentage of the essential oils, followed by linalool, estragole, and eugenol, regardless of the LEDs. In conclusion, the B2:R3 :W5 light treatment was the most suitable one for increasing polyphenols and the yield of essential oils in sweet basil.

Six-week-old seedlings were transplanted in a deep flow technique system with Hoagland NS with a 2.0 dS.m(-1) EC for the initial week. From eight days after transplanting, the plants were treated with six EC treatments of 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 6.0, and 8.0 dS.m(-1) for three weeks. Plant growth parameters, leaf gas exchange parameters, the relative chlorophyll value, and the ratio of variable to maximum fluorescence (F-v/F-m) were measured, and the rosmarinic acid (RA), tilianin, and acacetin concentrations were analyzed at 28 days after transplanting. The results showed that almost all plant growth parameters were maximized at 2.0 and 4.0 dS.m(-1) and minimized at 8.0 dS.m(-1) compared with the other EC treatments. The relative chlorophyll and F-v/F-m values were maximized at 2.0 and 4.0 dS.m(-1). Similarly, leaf gas exchange parameters were increased at 2.0 and 4.0 dS.m(-1). The RA content exhibited significantly higher values at 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 dS.m(-1) compared with other treatments. The tilianin and acacetin contents exhibited the significantly highest values at 4.0 and 0.5 dS.m (-1), respectively. These results suggest optimal EC treatment at 4.0 dS.m(-1) for increasing bioactive compounds in A. rugosa plants without decreasing plant growth. Excessively high or low EC induced salinity stress or nutrient deficiency, respectively. Furthermore, among the plant organs, the roots of A. rugosa contained the highest RA concentration and the flowers contained the highest tilianin and acacetin concentrations, which revealed a higher utilization potential of the roots and flowers for bioactive compounds.

Rchb. f. is a famous understory shade-obligated species with significant values as a source of herb medicine. Dry mass production is the main purpose that most cultural projects of B. striata cultivars purchase, but the current cultivation regime of B. striata is hard to advance its biomass accumulation. Therefore, this study was conducted to test the spectral effect on growth and dry mass in B. striata seedlings and further detect the physiological and biochemical responses accordingly as explanation for the mechanism. In a semi-plant factory condition, B. striata seedlings were cultured under three spectra with average photosynthetic photon flux rate of 74 lamol ill(-2) s(-1) given by light-emitting diodes (LEDs): R1BG5, 13.9% red, 77% green and 9.2% blue; R2BG3, 26.2% red, 70.2% green, and 3.5% blue; R3BG1, 42.3% red, 57.3% green, and 0.4% blue. Seedlings in the R3BG1 treatment generally showed faster growth and biomass accumulation in both shoot and root parts relative to the R1BG5 treatment. The red-light high spectmm also resulted in faster nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) uptake which countered nutrient deficiency in blue-high spectrum. Leaves expanded in area at highest efficiency in red-light high spectrum with even faster rate of biomass accumulation and nutrient uptake; while roots were proliferated faster in substrates but biomass allocation to roots was not modified by spectra so did root P uptake. Overall, B. striata should be cultured in redlight high spectrum and taken above-ground organs as the source of dry mass production.

A relative longer light cycle [12/12 h (light/dark)] increased not only light-response curve parameters, such as light-saturated net photosynthetic rate, light-saturation point, light-compensation point, dark respiration rate, but also upregulated CO2-response curves parameters, such as CO2-saturated net photosynthetic rate, initial carboxylation efficiency, and photorespiration rate, compared to those of the shorter light cycles [6/6 h and 3/3 h (light/dark)]. A longer light cycle enhanced electron transfer potential, increased the chlorophyll amount, leaf area, and biomass and reduced the root/shoot ratio and the specific leaf area. Our results imply that the prolonged light cycle led to the increase in photosynthetic capacity and significantly enhanced the growth rate of lettuce.	[Zhou, J.; Wang, J.

Red and blue lights have been considered to best drive photosynthetic metabolism and are beneficial for plant growth and development, and green light was seen as a signal to slow down or stop. In this study, Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) was used to investigate the effects of red, blue and green lights on the growth and development of plants from seed germination to seeding. Results demonstrated that red light showed a promotion effect but blue light a prohibition one in most stages except for the flowering time in which the effect of each light was just reversed. When mixed with red or blue light, green light generally at least partially cancelled out the effects caused by each of them. Results also showed that the same number of photons the plant received could cause different effects and choosing the right combination of different color of lights is essential in both promoting the growth and development of plants and reducing the energy consumption of lighting in plant factory.

Studies on effects of lighting strategies on plant growth, such as different light intensities, photoperiods, and their combinations, have been widely conducted. However, research on application of multi-segment light strategies and associated plant growth mechanisms is still relatively lacking. In the present study, two lighting strategies, multi-segment light intensity and extended photoperiod, were compared with a constant light intensity with a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle and the same daily light integral (DLI). Both lighting strategies promoted plant growth but acted via different mechanisms. The multi-segment light intensity lighting strategy promoted plant growth by decreasing non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) of the excited state of chlorophyll and increasing the quantum yield of PSII electron transport (PhiPSII), quantum yield of the carboxylation rate (PhiCO(2)), and photochemical quenching (qP), also taking advantage of the circadian rhythm. The extended photoperiod lighting strategy promoted plant growth by compensating for weak light stress and increasing light-use efficiency by increasing chlorophyll content under weak light conditions.

J	Zheng, JF; Ji, F; He, DX; Niu, GH				Zheng, Jianfeng; Ji, Fang; He, Dongxian; Niu, Genhua			Effect of Light Intensity on Rooting and Growth of Hydroponic Strawberry Runner Plants in a LED Plant Factory	AGRONOMY-BASEL			English	Article						vegetative propagation; strawberry transplant; cutting; rooting stage; seedling stage; daily light integral; photosynthetic activity	FLUORESCENCE; CUTTINGS; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; QUALITY; PROPAGATION; MORPHOLOGY; IMPATIENS; RESPONSES; INTEGRALS; STRESS	To rapidly produce strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa Duch. cv. Benihoppe) transplants from cuttings, suitable light intensities for unrooted runner plants at the rooting stage and rooted runner plants at the seedling stage were determined in a plant factory under LED lighting. At the rooting stage, unrooted runner plants at the 3-leaf stage were hydroponically rooted for 6 days under light intensity of 30, 90, 150, and 210 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), respectively. At the seedling stage, rooted runner plants were hydroponically grown for 18 days under light intensity of 90, 180, 270, and 360 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), respectively. The tube LED lights consisting of white and red LED chips were used as sole light source, and photoperiod was controlled as 16 h d(-1). The results showed that the maximum root number (7.7) and longest root length (14.8 cm) of the runner plants were found under 90 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) at the rooting stage. Photosynthetic activity in runner plant leaves under 90 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) were higher than that under 30, 150, and 210 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). Higher light intensity at the range of 90-270 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) increased the stomatal conductance of newly formed leaves of rooted runner plants, thus improving the net photosynthetic rate and growth of rooted runner plants at the seedling stage. The crown diameter, shoot and root dry weights, and root to shoot ratio of rooted runner plants increased by 9.7%, 38.8%, 106.1%, and 48.7%, respectively, when the light intensity increased from 90 to 270 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). However, there was no further improvement of runner plant growth under 360 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). Furthermore, no significant difference of increased dry biomass per mole of photons delivered was found between 180 and 270 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). In consideration of transplant quality and economic balance, light intensity of 90 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) at the rooting stage and 270 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) at the seedling stage were suggested for rapidly producing hydroponic strawberry transplants based on unrooted runner plants in the LED plant factory.

Although ginseng berries contain 4-10 times more ginsenosides than ginseng roots, a sustainable method has been established for ginseng root production but not for ginseng berry production. We elucidated the best conditions for stable berry production by cultivating four-year-old ginsengs on a developed vertical farm (VF) platform in a 3-level stereoscopic facility. Ginseng was cultivated in soil in mesh containers in three levels of cultivation shelves (W 0.85 m x D 4.80 m x H 1.15 m) installed in a cultivation room (W 5.88 m x 10.00 m x H 6.00 m). Each plant produced approximately 15 berries (3 g) in the VF, which is as many as those produced by plants in open fields (OF). Ginsenoside Rg1 and syringaresinol levels were higher in the berries from the VF than in those from the OF. In contrast, levels of total ginsenosides Rc, Rb2, and Rd were lower in berries from the VF than in those from the OF. Further, the levels of ginsenoside Re (major ginsenoside in ginseng berries from VF) were similar in the VF and OF. This difference in chemical composition can be attributed to the less variable environmental conditions in the VF compared to the OF. Berry yield strongly correlated with stem diameter and root weight. We thus conclude that this VF platform could be used to produce as many ginseng berries as an OF would produce. Additionally, it could be used for year-round production, thus enabling constant supply of therapeutically useful ginseng berries.

J	Zheng, JF; He, DX; Ji, F				Zheng, Jianfeng; He, Dongxian; Ji, Fang			Effects of light intensity and photoperiod on runner plant propagation of hydroponic strawberry transplants under LED lighting	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						hydroponic strawberry; vegetative propagation; daily light integral; photon yield	GROWTH; LENGTH; NUMBER	Vegetative propagation of strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa Duch.) in the plant factory with artificial lighting is considered as an effective approach to produce high-quality transplants. In this study, mother plants of 'Benihoppe' strawberry were grown hydroponically for 50 d under eight LED lighting treatments by combining four levels of light intensity (200, 250, 300 and 350 mu mol/(m(2).s)) and two photoperiods (12 h/d and 16 h/d). Runner development, growth of runner plants, photon yield and energy yield in runners and runner plants were investigated to evaluate the strawberry propagation efficiency. Results indicated that length of runners decreased linearly with increasing daily light integral (DLI) under each photoperiod and was significantly shorter under photoperiod of 16 h/d. Runner elongation was inhibited by high DLI. Number of runners and runner plants formed by mother plants increased by 38.9% and 33.7%, when DLI increased from 8.6 to 11.5 mol/(m(2).d), respectively; however, no further increase was observed when DLI was higher than 11.5 mol/(m(2).d). Similar trends were found in crown diameter and biomass of primary and secondary runner plants. Negative impact of high DLI (20.2 mol/(m(2).d)) on photosynthetic capacity of runner plants was observed as a decrease in leaf net photosynthetic rate, potential maximum photochemical efficiency of PSII, and chlorophyll content. Furthermore, photon yield and energy yield in runners and runner plants decreased significantly with increasing DLI. Therefore, DLI in a range of 11.5-17.3 mol/(m(2).d) is beneficial to improve strawberry propagation efficiency and quality of runner plants, and 11.5 mol/(m(2).d) is optimal for the strawberry propagation of runner plants in the LED plant factory because of the higher photon and energy yields.

LEAVES; GROWTH; PHYTOCHEMICALS; CULTIVARS; CAPACITY; TIME	Since kale (Brassica oleracea L. var. acephala) is one of the healthiest vegetables, its cultivation is increasing for either fresh consumption or as a source for functional foods and nutraceuticals. Plant factories are able to control the environment and trigger the accumulation of bioactive compounds with a stable supply by systematic cultivation methods. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the changes in the total phenolic compounds (TPCs), total flavonoid compounds (TFCs), glucosinolates (GLSs), and antioxidant capacity of kale in a plant factory and to determine an optimal harvest time for the maximum annual production. Two cultivars, namely 'Manchoo collard' and 'Jangsoo collard', were cultivated in a plant factory and thinned to avoid mutual shading. Both cultivars were harvested every week from 14 to 49 days after transplanting (DAT). The fresh weight (FW), dry weight (DW), projected leaf area (PLA), TPCs, TFCs, GLSs, and antioxidant capacity of both plants were measured every week. The annual production was calculated as follows: DW x the concentration x planting density x cultivation cycles per year. The optimal harvest time was determined based on the continuous phase of the production by modeling. The FW and DW of both cultivars exponentially increased, but the PLA hardly increased at 35 DAT. The TPCs, TFCs, and antioxidant capacity fluctuated or slightly changed, but the amount of substance per plant gradually increased. Their annual production increased with increasing harvest time, and only the production of TPCs in 'Manchoo collard' showed a local maximum when harvested at 35-42 DAT. Glucoiberin, sinigrin, and glucobrassicin were the major components of GLSs in both cultivars, and their contents fluctuated. The concentration of total GLSs was the highest at 42 DAT. Additionally, the annual production of the total and major GLSs showed the same results as the TPCs, TFCs, and antioxidant capacity. From the results, the optimum harvest time for production was determined to be 42 DAT.

The goal of this study was to investigate the effects of UV-A LEDs at different wavelengths (366, 390, and 402 nm) and durations (10 and 16 h) on the growth and phytochemical contents of mustard microgreens (Brassica juncea L. cv. "Red Lion"), when used as supplemental light to the main LED lighting system (with peak wavelengths of 447, 638, 665, and 731 nm). Plants were grown for 10 days under a total photon flux density (TPFD) of 300 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) and 16-h light/8-h dark period. Different UV-A wavelengths and irradiance durations had varied effects on mustard microgreens. Supplemental UV-A radiation did not affect biomass accumulation; however, the longest UV-A wavelength (402 nm) increased the leaf area of mustard microgreens, regardless of the duration of irradiance. The concentration of the total phenolic content and alpha-tocopherol mostly increased under 402-nm UV-A, while that of nitrates increased under 366- and 390-nm UV-A at both radiance durations. The contents of lutein/zeaxanthin and beta-carotene increased in response to the shortest UV-A wavelength (366 nm) at 10-h irradiance as well as longer UV-A wavelength (390 nm) at 16 h irradiance. The most positive effect on the accumulation of mineral elements, except iron, was observed under longer UV-A wavelengths at 16-h irradiance. Overall, these results suggest that properly composed UV-A LED parameters in LED lighting systems could improve the nutritional quality of mustard microgreens, without causing any adverse effects on plant growth.

Coriander is an important herbal vegetable and contains abundant secondary metabolites, vitamins, and minerals, which are essential for human health. Five different light qualities, red (R), blue (B), green (G), red:blue (RB, ratio of 87:13), and red:blue:far-red (RBFr, ratio of 81.5:12.5:6) were applied to identify the optimal light quality for enhancing the growth and accumulation of minerals and bioactive metabolites in coriander. Results showed that biomass, chlorophyll index, and ascorbic acid content of coriander plants were significantly higher in RB or RBFr light treatments than in other light treatments. The antioxidant capacity and total phenolic content were the highest under B light. The total phenolic content per plant was the highest under RBFr light due to the high growth rate and biomass production of the plants. Besides, tipburn occurrence in coriander was not affected by total Ca content in the shoot. RBFr was found to be the optimal light spectrum for producing coriander with high yield and contents of ascorbic acid, total phenolics, Ca, and P in a plant factory.	[Nguyen, Duyen T.

In this context, sustainability in small-scale indoor cultivation systems is crucial. Sustainability can be achieved by optimizing all the cultivation factors involved in the production process. The effects of different photoperiod conditions under different timing during plant development-from sowing to germination and maturity-have been studied in a small-scale indoor cultivation area. The main objective of this research was to investigate the possibilities of an optimized photoperiod for basil plants to reduce the energy demand cost of the cultivation unit. Three different photoperiod treatments (P8D16L, P10D14L, and P11D13L) were applied to basil plants with stable light intensity. Furthermore, the photoperiod was shortened to test the reaction of the biomass from the plants in a reduced energy demand system. The dry biomass produced was measured along with the energy consumed in each treatment. The basil quality was assessed by measuring different physiological indices, such as chlorophyll a (Chl a), chlorophyll b (Chl b), total chlorophyll (Chl tot), the fraction of photosynthetically active irradiance absorbed by the leaf, and leaf temperature. The results of the study showed that a shorter photoperiod did not negatively affect the quantity and quality of the basil plants. Continuously, the evaluation of the energy demand variation under the different photoperiod treatments can provide a significant positive impact on the energetic, ecological, and economic aspects of small-scale food production.

In this study, effects of DLI and LED light quality (LQ) on growth, nutritional quality, and energy use efficiency of hydroponic lettuce were investigated in a plant factory with artificial lighting (PFAL). Hydroponic lettuce plants (cv. Ziwei) were grown for 20 days under 20 combinations of five levels of DLIs at 5.04, 7.56, 10.08, 12.60, and 15.12 mol.m(-2).d(-1) and four LQs: two kinds of white LEDs with red to blue ratio (R:B ratio) of 0.9 and 1.8, and two white LEDs plus red chips with R:B ratio of 2.7 and 3.6, respectively. Results showed that leaf and root weights and power consumption based on fresh and dry weights increased linearly with increasing DLI, and light and electrical energy use efficiency (LUE and EUE) decreased linearly as DLI increased. However, no statistically significant differences were found in leaf fresh and dry weights and nitrate and vitamin C contents between DLI at 12.60 and 15.12 mol.m(-2).d(-1). Also, no effects of LQ on leaf dry weight of hydroponic lettuce were observed at a DLI of 5.04 mol.m(-2).d(-1). White plus red LEDs with an R:B ratio of 2.7 resulted in higher leaf fresh weight than the two white LEDs. LUE increased by more than 20% when red light fraction increased from 24.2% to 48.6%. In summary, white plus red LEDs with an R:B ratio of 2.7 at DLI at 12.60 mol.m(-2).d(-1) were recommended for commercial hydroponic lettuce (cv. Ziwei) production in PFALs.

Far-red radiation interacts with relative and absolute blue and red photon flux densities to regulate growth, morphology, and pigmentation of lettuce and basil seedlings	SCIENTIA HORTICULTURAE			English	Article						Controlled environment; Leafy greens; Light-Emitting diode; Radiation quality; Phytochrome; Sole-Source lighting; Vertical farming	LIGHT-EMITTING-DIODES; ANTHOCYANIN ACCUMULATION; SHADE-AVOIDANCE; ARABIDOPSIS-THALIANA; BRASSICA-NAPUS; PHYTOCHROME B; PLANT-GROWTH; LEAF LETTUCE; RESPONSES; ACCLIMATION	Although outside the photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) waveband (400-700 nm), far-red (FR; 700-800 nm) radiation regulates photomorphogenesis and photochemistry, thereby meriting consideration in sole-source plant-lighting applications. We investigated how FR radiation interacted with the ratio of blue (B; 400-500 nm) to red (R; 600-700 nm) radiation (B:R) (experiment I) and PPFD (experiment II) to regulate seedling growth under sole-source lighting. We postulated that adding FR radiation to B + R radiation would increase leaf expansion and thus radiation capture to promote whole-plant photosynthesis, but that FR effects would depend on B:R and PPFD. In experiment I, lettuce (Lactuca saliva) 'Rex' and 'Cherokee' and basil (Ocimwn basilicum) 'Genovese' were continuously irradiated by 180 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) of B and/or R radiation [B30R150 (low B:R), B90R90 (high B:R), R-180, or B-180, where subscripts indicate respective photon flux densities in mu mol m(-2) s(-1)] with or without 30 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) of FR radiation. Twelve and 16 days after seed sow for lettuce and basil, respectively, the addition of FR radiation increased leaf length and shoot weight of all crops with more pronounced impacts under high B:R than low B:R. It also increased root dry weight of basil and lettuce 'Cherokee'. Adding FR to B + R radiation reduced specific chlorophyll content in lettuce by 10-20%, but not in basil. Red pigmentation of lettuce 'Cherokee' increased with increasing B:R but decreased with the inclusion of FR radiation. In experiment II, we grew lettuce 'Rex' (for 8 days) and 'RouxaF' (for 10 days) under B90R90 (low PPFD) or B180R180 (high PPFD) at the same B:R with or without FR radiation at 30 or 75 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). Additional FR radiation increased lettuce shoot weight and extension growth but reduced relative specific chlorophyll content under both PPFDs, although FR effects were attenuated under the high PPFD. Shoot dry weight, relative specific chlorophyll content, and red foliage pigmentation increased with PPFD. We conclude that FR enrichment improves photosynthetic radiation capture and thus promotes crop growth under sole-source lighting, and that its effects are especially pronounced under high B:R and a low PPFD.

J	Liu, N; Ji, F; Xu, LJ; He, DX				Liu, Nan; Ji, Fang; Xu, Lijun; He, Dongxian			Effects of LED light quality on the growth of pepper seedling in plant factory	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						pepper seedlings; LED light quality; R: B ratio; light energy use efficiency (LUE); electric energy use efficiency (EUE)	PHOTOSYNTHETIC CHARACTERISTICS; EMITTING-DIODES; RED-LIGHT; SUPPLEMENTAL BLUE; LETTUCE; RESPONSES; YIELD	The extensive environment, especially low temperature and weak lighting in winter and spring, which limits the growth of pepper (Capicum annuum L.) seedlings, the use of plant factory with artificial lighting technology can effectively control the lighting environment to produce high-quality seedlings. In this study, white LED lamps with R:B ratio of 0.7 (L0.7) and 1.5 (L1.5) and red-blue LED lamps with R:B ratio of 3.5 (L3.5) were used to cultivate seedlings of "CAU-24" pepper in the light intensity of 250 mu mol/m(2).s and photoperiod of 12 h/d, white fluorescent lamps with R:B ratio of 1.7 (F1.7) was used as control. The results showed that plant height, stem diameter, hypocotyl length, biomass accumulation, light energy use efficiency (LUE) and electric energy use efficiency (EUE) of pepper seedling under L1.5 were the highest. After 36 days of sowing, the dry weight of shoot reached 302.8 +/- 45.2 mg/plant. Leaf area reached maximum value of 153.5 +/- 22.0 cm(2) under L0.7. The contents of chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b and total chlorophyll of pepper seedling leaves under all kinds of LED light were greater than F1.7, but there was no significant difference in net photosynthetic rate. The total dry weight with lamp electric power consumption of L1.5 were 3.0 g/(kW.h) which was 1.5, 2, and 3 times greater than that of L3.5, L0.7, and F1.7, respectively. Therefore, compared with fluorescent lamp and other LED lamps, the white LED light quality with R:B ratio of 1.5 is suitable for pepper seedling production in plant factory because of the high LED lighting efficiency, greater LUE and EUE.

Integrating Morphological and Physiological Responses of Tomato Plants to Light Quality to the Crop Level by 3D Modeling	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE			English	Article						spectral composition of light; photomorphogenesis; functional-structural plant model; green light; blue light; red light	GREEN-LIGHT; BLUE-LIGHT; RED-LIGHT; SHADE AVOIDANCE; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; GROWTH; ENVIRONMENT; SEEDLINGS; SPECTRUM; PETUNIA	Next to its intensity, the spectral composition of light is one of the most important factors affecting plant growth and morphology. The introduction of light emitting diodes (LEDs) offers perspectives to design optimal light spectra for plant production systems. However, knowledge on the effects of light quality on physiological plant processes is still limited. The aim of this study is to determine the effects of six light qualities on growth and plant architecture of young tomato plants, and to upscale these effects to the crop level using a multispectral, functional-structural plant model. Young tomato plants were grown under 210 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) blue, green, amber, red, white or red/blue (92%/8%) LED light with a low intensity of sunlight as background. Plants grown under blue light were shorter and developed smaller leaves which were obliquely oriented upward. Leaves grown under blue light contained the highest levels of light harvesting pigments, but when exposed to blue light only, they had the lowest rate of leaf photosynthesis. However, when exposed to white light these leaves had the highest rate of photosynthesis. Under green light, tomato plants were taller and leaves were nearly horizontally oriented, with a high specific leaf area. The open plant structure combined with a high light transmission and reflection at the leaf level allowed green light to penetrate deeper into the canopy. Plants grown under red, amber and white light were comparable with respect to height, leaf area and biomass production. The 3D model simulations indicated that the observed changes in plant architecture had a significant impact on light absorbance at the leaf and crop level The combination of plant architecture and spectrum dependent photosynthesis was found to result in the highest rate of crop photosynthesis under red light in plants initially grown under green light. These results suggest that dynamic light spectra may offer perspectives to increase growth and production in high value production systems such as greenhouse horticulture and vertical farming.

Quantum dot (QD) refers to ultrafine semiconductor particles and is expressed in a variety of wavelength ranges and fine and precise colors and is attracting attention as a next-generation material. This study was conducted to investigate the effects of various light qualities, including a QD-LED light source on the growth and color development of red romaine lettuce in the LED chamber system for plant factories. The light source was red fluorescent (FL), blue (B), red (R), blue + red mixed light (BR), and blue + wide range red + red mixed light QD-LED. The growth index, chlorophyll content, and leaf color were examined. The results showed that the plant length was long without a significant difference in QD-LED and the red (R) wavelength and showed the fastest growth under QD-LED. The photosynthetic rate and chlorophyll content were the highest in QD-LED light with a broad spectrum of red light. The leaf colors a*, b*, the hue angle, and total anthocyanin content showed the highest in QD-LED light, while b* and the hue angle values were the lowest. As the light wavelength range was changed, there was a significant difference in the growth response and leaf color, and it is considered that QD-LED light should be considered positively when applied to plant factories.

J	Zha, LY; Zhang, YB; Liu, WK				Zha, Lingyan; Zhang, Yubin; Liu, Wenke			Dynamic Responses of Ascorbate Pool and Metabolism in Lettuce to Long-term Continuous Light Provided by Red and Blue LEDs	ENVIRONMENTAL AND EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY			English	Article						Ascorbic acid; Enzyme activity; Gene expression; Ascorbate-Glutathione cycle; Hydrogen peroxide; Plant factory	HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE; GENE-EXPRESSION; VITAMIN-C; GLUTATHIONE; ACID; PLANTS; DEHYDROGENASE; ACCUMULATION; TOLERANCE; STRESS	To understand the dynamic changes of lettuce growth, ascorbate pool and metabolism under long-term red and blue continuous light (CL, 24/0 h, 200 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1)), growth parameters, ascorbate pool size, as well as activities and gene expression levels of key enzymes involved in the ascorbate metabolism in lettuce leaves were investigated every 3 days during 15 days. In comparison with normal photoperiod (Control, 16/8 h, 200 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1)), lettuce plants gained greater shoot fresh weight and dry matter under CL, which depended more on specific leaf weight than leaf area. Both reduced ascorbate (MA) and dehydroascorbate (DHA) contents were remarkably enhanced by CL and keep a relatively stable level during the experiment. The consistent greater contents of AsA and DHA were respectively attributed to the up -regulation of L-galactono-1,4-lactone dehydrogenase and ascorbate peroxidase activity rather than their gene expression. Although glutathione contents and glutathione reductase activities were elevated by CL, their contribution to MA regeneration was limited on account of similar activity and expression level of dehydroascorbate reductase with control. In addition, H202 content was also raised obviously under CL compared with control, but it was maintained at a relative safety and stable level from day 6. Fluorescence imaging results also showed that CL did not induce oxidative damage on lettuce leaves compared with control. It is concluded that lettuce plants grown under red and blue continuous light for 15 days obtained greater shoot biomass and ascorbate pool size without leaf injury, and 9 days was the most cost-effective duration for yield improvement from an energy standpoint. Ascorbate accumulation under continuous light was primarily and rapidly regulated by the enzymes involved in AsA biosynthesis and oxidation at enzymatic activity level rather than gene expression level.

J	Hang, T; Lu, N; Takagaki, M; Mao, HP				Hang, Teng; Lu, Na; Takagaki, Michiko; Mao, Hanping			Leaf area model based on thermal effectiveness and photosynthetically active radiation in lettuce grown in mini-plant factories under different light cycles	SCIENTIA HORTICULTURAE			English	Article						Product of thermal effectiveness and PAR (TEP); Leaf area model; Lettuce; Light cycle; Mini-PFAL; Morphogenesis	TEMPERATURES; ACCUMULATION; MECHANISMS; TIME	To establish an effective leaf area model in a mini plant factory with artificial lighting (mini-PFAL) environment, we conducted three experiments exposing lettuce plants to different light cycles. Three treatments were set up in the first experiment: 12-h/12-h (light/dark), 6-h/6-h (light/dark), and 3-h/3-h (light/dark). We analyzed the dynamic changes in the lettuce leaf area under different light cycles in a mini-PFAL and established a leaf area model based on the accumulated product of thermal effectiveness and photosynthetically active radiation (TEP) method. Data from two subsequent experiments were used to validate the lettuce leaf area model and uncover the difference in plant growth caused by different light/dark cycle patterns from a physiological perspective. Results show that the TEP and light cycle influenced lettuce leaf area significantly. Under 12-h/12-h (light/dark) treatment, lettuce growth was better than in 6-h/6-h (light/dark) and 3-h/3-h (light/dark) conditions within the same TEP. The light cycle appeared to significantly affect the leaf area as well as morphogenesis. The shape of lettuce leaves was slenderer and the leaf angle was steeper under the longer light cycle. We believed the different illumination durations in a single light cycle altered the functional relationships between phytochromes and led to different plant shapes. At the same time, the plant shape caused different light interceptions that affected the growth and leaf areas. A relative longer light period (6-h light/6-h dark) increased leaf stomata] conductance, net photosynthetic rate, and plant growth, compared to those of a shorter light period (3-h light/3-h dark). Based on these results, this study provides useful insights on regulation strategies related to light cycles and their effects on lettuce growth.

In our first experiment, lettuce was grown in renewed, non-renewed and non-renewed + ED solution. Every two weeks interval nutrient solution was changed in the renewed treatment while non-renewed solution was unchanged throughout the growing period but major minerals were adjusted bi-weekly. ED was also applied bi-weekly for 24 h. Compared to renewed solution, shoot fresh weight was decreased to 24% (301.8 g plant(-1)) in non-renewed solution. But when ED was applied, non-renewed + ED solution produced shoot fresh weight statistically similar to renewed solution plants. In the second experiment, lettuce was grown in renewed nutrient solution, one culture non-renewed (non-renewed 1C), two culture non-renewed (non-renewed 2C) and non-renewed 2C + ED solutions. In non-renewed 1C, the starting solution was fresh nutrient solution while in non-renewed 2C it was once used. Lettuce grown in non-renewed 2C solution produced shoot fresh yield (258.8 g plant(-1)), about 35% lower compared to renewed solution. When ED was applied to non-renewed 2C solution produced shoot fresh weight 383.3 g plant(-1) which was statistically similar to renewed solution. Calcium and iron concentration in lettuce followed the similar trend. Therefore, it was evident that yield and quality of lettuce could be improved through ED in non-renewed solution in two successive cultivations using same nutrient solution. In the following study, we tried to determine the proper ED interval in the third experiment. Results showed that ED to non-renewed solution both weekly and bi-weekly equally improved growth, yield and mineral concentration in lettuce. Hence, ED at two weeks interval was sufficient.

J	Kong, YY; Nemali, A; Mitchell, C; Nemali, K				Kong, Yuyao; Nemali, Ajay; Mitchell, Cary; Nemali, Krishna			Spectral Quality of Light Can Affect Energy Consumption and Energy-use Efficiency of Electrical Lighting in Indoor Lettuce Farming	HORTSCIENCE			English	Article						broad spectrum; hydroponics; Lactuca sativa; phosphor-converted LED; purple light; vertical farm; white light	BLUE-LIGHT; RED-LIGHT; GREEN-LIGHT; GROWTH; WHITE; LEDS	High energy-use cost for electric lighting is one of the major issues challenging sustainability of the indoor lettuce-farming industry. Thus, maximizing electrical energy-use efficiency (EUE, g.KWh(-1)), defined as the ratio of dry matter production (g) to electrical energy consumption (EEC, KWh(-1)), is crucial during indoor production. Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are energy efficient and highly suitable for indoor farms. Research on optimal spectral quality of LEDs for lettuce growth is extensive; however, there is limited research examining LED spectral quality effects on EEC and EUE. Photon efficiency, defined as the ratio of light output to electrical energy input (PE, mu mol.J(-1)), generally is used for selection of LED fixtures. Because PE does not account for differences in emitted light spectrum, it is not clear whether light-fixture selection based on PE can maximize EUE in lettuce production. This study comprised two experiments. In Expt. 1, we used four "phosphor-converted'' commercial LEDs with different light intensities and spectra to model the effect of light spectral quality on lettuce shoot dry weight (SDW), EEC, and EUE. We also evaluated relations between EUE vs. PE and EUE vs. PER (PE based on red light) for indoor lettuce production. Results indicated that light spectral quality affected SDW, EEC, and EUE in lettuce production. Fitted models indicated that EEC increased linearly with increasing percentage of red-light output and was unaffected by other spectral colors or ratios. However, EUE increased in a curvilinear fashion with an increasing ratio of red to blue (R:B) light and reached a maximum at a ratio of 4.47. Similar to EUE, SDW also responded in a curvilinear fashion to R:B. Results also indicated that EUE correlated poorly with PE but linearly to PER. In Expt. 2, we grew three lettuce varieties under two commercial LED fixtures. They had similar levels of PE but different percentages of red, R:B, and PER values. Regardless of the variety, fixtures with greater percentages of red, R:B, and PER significantly increased EUE. We conclude that red-light quality is an important determinant of EUE and growers should select fixtures based on R:B and high PER in indoor lettuce farming.

The demand for high-quality and fresh coriander in large cities has been growing rapidly. Plant factories are advanced indoor cultivation systems that can produce high-quality plants inside cities with a high productivity. This study aimed to maximize plant growth and the secondary metabolites production of coriander, by regulating photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) and root-zone temperature (RZT). Three PPFDs (100, 200, and 300 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) and three RZTs (20, 25, and 30 degrees C) were applied on coriander plants grown hydroponically in a plant factory. The plant biomass and water content of leaf and stem were highest under RZT of 25 degrees C with a PPFD of 300 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). However, chlorogenic acid, rutin, trans-2-decenal, total phenolic concentrations and the antioxidant capacity of the coriander plant were greatest under the combination of PPFD (300 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) and RZT (30 degrees C). Chlorogenic acid in leaves responded more sensitively to PPFD and RZT than rutin. Controlling PPFD and RZT is effective in optimizing the yield and quality of coriander plants. The findings are expected to be applied to commercial plant production in plant factories.	[Nguyen, Duyen T.

Three-week-old C. denticulatum seedlings were transplanted into a PFAL where the air temperature, relative humidity, CO2 concentration, and light period were set at 20 degrees C, 60%, 1000molmol(-1), and 16h, respectively. Three controls were used with different ratios of R to B light without supplemental FR light: 8:2, 7:3, and 6:4 (based on chip number; 130 mu molm(-2)s(-1) photosynthetic photon flux density). For the treatments, the same R to B light ratios as in the controls were used but supplemented with FR light, plus a treatment with only R light supplemented with FR, set to a PSS of 0.71. Growth characteristics and total phenolic and individual phenolic contents were measured after a 6-week treatment. When the R light ratio increased, shoot dry weight, leaf length, leaf width, and leaf area increased regardless of supplemental FR light, and the R8B2 with FR light treatment was the most effective, with significantly higher values (1.6-2 times) than the control. FR irradiation did not have any negative effect on total phenolic content, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, and chicoric acid per unit dry weight (g); thus, the R8B2 with FR treatment had significantly higher total phenolic and individual phenolic contents per shoot (43% and 52-62%, respectively). Thus, supplemental lighting with FR LEDs was found to be effective to enhance the growth and bioactive compounds of C. denticulatum in a PFAL installed with a R and B lighting system, and the effectiveness could be changed by the RB ratio, with 8:2 considered the proper ratio.

Plants were raised in a closed-type plant factory under 250 molm(-2)s(-1) PPFD white light emitting diodes (LEDs) with additional light treatments. These treatments were designated long day (LD, 16 h light, 8 h dark), short day (SD, 8 h light, 16 h dark), and SD with a 4 h night interruption (NI). The NIL was constructed from 10 molm(-2)s(-1) or 20 molm(-2)s(-1) PPFD blue (NI-B), red (NI-R), white (NI-W), or blue and white (NI-BW) LEDs. In Spain', the SPAD value, area and thickness of leaves and plant height increased in the NI treatment as compared to the SD treatment. In Lipstick', most morphogenetic characteristics in the NI treatment showed no significant difference to those in the SD treatment. For both cultivars, plants in SD were significantly shorter than those in other treatments. The flowering of Kalanchoe Lipstick' was not affected by the NIL quality, while Kalanchoe Spain' flowered when grown in SD and 10 molm(-2)s(-1) PPFD NI-B. These results suggest that the NIL quality and intensity affect the morphogenesis and flowering of kalanchoe, and that different cultivars are affected differently. There is a need to further assess the effects of the NIL quality and intensity on the morphogenesis and flowering of short-day plants for practical NIL applications.

Three commercial crisphead lettuce cultivars (Adam', Manchu', and Sensation') were grown on deep flow technique beds in a closed-type plant factory under three different fluorescent light intensities [150, 200, and 250 mu molm(-2)s(-1) photosynthetic photon flux (PPF)] and two temperature conditions. The plants were grown until 60days after transplantation (DAT) under the high [22/18 degrees C (0-30 DAT)18/16 degrees C (30-60 DAT)] and low [18/16 degrees C (0-30 DAT)18/14 degrees C (30-60 DAT)] temperature conditions, with 50 +/- 10% relative humidity and a 12-h day length. Growth parameters, including head formation rate and tip burn incidence, were measured in all experiments. All cultivars exhibited significantly higher growth rates in the 250 mu molm(-2)s(-1) light intensity compared to lower light intensities under both temperature conditions, and showed a cultivar-specific difference in the growth pattern at different light intensities. Our cultivation trials suggest that Sensation' is ideal for production in closed-type plant factory systems at 250 mu molm(-2)s(-1) PPF due to its stable head formation and superior head quality. Under the high temperature condition, head formation was only observed in two cultivars, Sensation' and Adam', while all cultivars showed head formation in the low temperature condition. The initiation of head formation began at the 8-10 true-leaf stage around 20 DAT, and then apparent head formation was observed around 30 DAT, followed by an increase of head density until harvest (60 DAT). Tip burn symptoms were observed throughout the experiment, with higher values in the high temperature condition. The results of our study suggest that good head formation can be achieved under high light intensities (200 mu molm(-2)s(-1) PPF) and low temperature [18/16 degrees C (0-30 DAT) 18/14 degrees C (30-60 DAT)] in crisphead lettuce grown in a closed-type plant factory.

J	Liu, YW; Huang, CK				Liu, Yu-Wei; Huang, Chen-Kang			Effects of the Circulation Pump Type and Ultraviolet Sterilization on Nutrient Solutions and Plant Growth in Plant Factories	HORTTECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Fe ions; hydroponics; ion concentration; lettuce; strawberry; UV		Hydroponic systems in plant factories can be categorized into recirculating or noncirculating systems. In this study, the effects of various commercially available circulation pumps, including a centrifugal magnetic drive pump, a regenerative self-priming pump, and a submersible pump, were experimentally explored. In addition, the effects of an ultraviolet sterilization system on the ion concentrations in nutrient solutions were examined. The concentrations of sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, nitrate, sulfate, and ferric (Fe3+) ions in the nutrient solution were measured. For all three types of pumps, the results indicated that there was no significant effect on the concentrations of ions in the nutrient solution. However, the concentration of Fe3+ ions decreased significantly after the nutrient solution was treated by a ultraviolet sterilization system for 48 hours. In addition, the effects of the three types of pumps on the growth of butterhead lettuce (Lactuca sativa) were examined. The temperature records during the pump circulation tests showed that the nutrient solution temperature of the regenerative self-priming pump increased by 15.5 degrees C (from 20.5 to 36 degrees C), which caused yellow seedling, scorching on the leaves, and browning of the roots. The ion concentration in the nutrient solutions and total fresh weight of butterhead lettuce did not show any noticeable difference between the centrifugal magnetic drive pump and the submersible pump. In this paper, we clarify the cause of the decreasing iron concentration and provide a guideline for selecting the pump for circulating hydroponic systems in plant factories.

J	Park, YG; Jeong, BR				Park, Yoo Gyeong; Jeong, Byoung Ryong			Night interruption light quality changes morphogenesis, flowering, and gene expression in Dendranthema grandiflorum	HORTICULTURE ENVIRONMENT AND BIOTECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Blue light; Chrysanthemum; Floral signal; Light spectrum; Photomorphogenesis	CYCLAMEN-PERSICUM; LAMP TYPE; ARABIDOPSIS; PETUNIA; GROWTH; CHRYSANTHEMUM; RESPONSES; MUTANTS; LETTUCE; RED	We investigated the effects of the quality of light used for interrupting the night period, termed the night interruption light (NIL), on morphogenesis, flowering, and the expression of photoperiodic genes in chrysanthemum (Dendranthema grandiflorum) cultivar Gaya Yellow', a qualitative short-day (SD) plant. Plants were raised in a closed-type plant factory under white (W) light-emitting diodes (LEDs) providing a light intensity of 180molm(-2)s(-1) photosynthetic photon flux density, under a condition of long-day (LD, 16h light/8h dark), short-day (SD, 10h light/14h dark), or SD with a 4-h night interruption (NI) provided by 10molm(-2)s(-1) PPF green (NI-G), blue (NI-B), red (NI-R), far-red (NI-Fr), or W (NI-W) LEDs. Plants grown in the LD condition were the tallest. The SD, NI-B, and NI-Fr conditions induced flowering. Phytochrome A (phyA) and cryptochrome 1 (cry1) were expressed at high levels in plants in NI-B, NI-Fr, and SD conditions. These results suggest that the NIL quality has significant implications on morphogenesis, flowering, and the expression of photoperiodic genes. Flowering was positively affected by the expression of phyA, cry1, and FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), whereas it was negatively affected by the expression of phyB and anti-florigenic FT/TFL1 (AFT).

Here, we aim to devise a new way that allows for controlling the growth rate of plants in hydroponics as well as maintaining the product quality; we apply underwater ultrasound and dissolved oxygen supersaturation as external stimuli to plants. As an example, we examine the growth of leaf lettuce in hydroponics with exposure to 28-kHz ultrasound and dissolved oxygen supersaturation up to 36 mg/L at 20 degrees C. Our results show that exposure to the ultrasound of peak-to-peak pressure at 20 kPa or larger works as the growth inhibitor of the leaves and the roots, while the oxygen supersaturation as the growth promoter, without any degradation of chlorophyll in the leaves. This suggests that these external stimuli can be used in the growth control system of plant factories.

Growth of red pak choi under red and blue, supplemented white, and artificial sunlight provided by LEDs	SCIENTIA HORTICULTURAE			English	Article						White LEDs; Narrow band LEDs; Light recipe; Phytonutrients; Leafy greens; Vertical farming	LIGHT-EMITTING-DIODES; GREEN-LIGHT; PLANT-GROWTH; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; QUALITY; PHOTOMORPHOGENESIS; IRRADIATION; INTENSITY; LEAVES	To explore lighting strategies for crop production in space, we investigated the impacts of light spectrum on morphology, biomass, and phytonutrients of red pak choi (Brassica rapa var. chinensis, 'Ruin F-1') over a 28-day cycle. Light treatments were white light-emitting diodes (WLEDs) as a control, W + red (WR), W + green switched to red at 21 days (WG-R), W + far-red (WFR), red and blue (RB), and an LED-based artificial sunlight research module (ASRM). The photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) was maintained near 180 mu mol m(-2).s(-1) for all light treatments. Our results indicated that red pak choi grown under a narrow spectrum of RB light was most suitable for leaf expansion, biomass yield, and relative anthocyanin accumulation. The various broad-spectrum WLED treatments reduced yield, leaf area, and anthocyanin content. Supplemental G and FR augmented the reduction of growth and phytonutrients, however chlorophyll and anthocyanin levels recovered to levels comparable to the control within 7 days of switching WG to WR. The ASRM was used to assess direct sunlight as an alternative lighting option for plant growth in space. ASRM increased overall yield and specific leaf weight compared to WLED and supplemental treatments, and was similar to plants grown under RB in terms of fresh/dry weight, but lower in phytonutrients. Our results suggest both narrow and broad-band light sources can be used to manipulate morphology, phytonutrients, and partitioning of biomass in red pak choi.	[Mickens, M.

Effect of growing strawberries with superimposed levels of cropgutters on yield and quality	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE			English	Article						vertical farming; soilless culture; plant density; fruit quality	GROWTH; FRUIT; SYSTEM; LIGHT; BEDS	This experiment was carried out to assess the effect of increasing plant density by superimposing immovable levels of cropgutters. The greenhouse glazing was an air-inflated double layer of F-CLEAN (R), a specific version of ethylene tetrafluoroethylene. The inside layer was diffused F-CLEAN (R), in order to reduce the direct shading of the lower gutters by the upper levels. In this multi-span greenhouse were arranged, each in an 8-m wide span: a) the traditional single-level crop of 7 cropping lines, density 8.75 plants m(-2); b) two levels of five cropping lines each (12.5 plants m(-2) ); c) three levels of five cropping lines each (18.75 plants m(-2)). In the two- and three-level system, the immovable cropgutters were vertically aligned: all the cropping operations could be done from the ground or using mobile platforms to adjust the working height to the upper levels. Two early cultivars, 'Gariguette' and 'Ciflorette', were grown as a soilless heated crop with trayplants planted on 14 December 2015. PAR light at the top of the canopy was reduced on the lower and the intermediate levels of the two- and three-level disposition; the highest reduction was measured on the lowest level of the three-level disposition. The changes observed in the content of total soluble solids (% Brix) and titratable acidity due to shading remained acceptable. Yield per plant was significantly reduced on the lower and intermediate levels of the three-level disposition, but not on the lower level of the two-level disposition, nor on the upper levels of both dispositions. However, with two and three levels, the higher density per square meter led to a higher yield per square meter, compared to the traditional single-level crop: +40% (two-level system) and +82% (three-level system) for 'Gariguette', +48% and +86% for 'Ciflorette'.

The quantification of the components, however, is mainly conducted by laboratory analyses, which are both time- and labor-consuming. The present study aimed to investigate the potential of a non-destructive diffuse reflectance spectroscopy technique for estimating functional components (i.e. glucosinolates, amino acids, sugars and carotenoids) in the leaves of Chinese cabbage grown in a plant factory. RESULTS From the overall analysis, better estimations were obtained using the partial least square regression procedure. The important wavelengths for each functional component were identified mainly in the ultraviolet-visible regions. Identified wavelengths were 317, 390, 888 and 940 nm for sugars; 520 and 960 nm for amino acids; 385, 860 and 945 nm for glucosinolates; and 454, 472 and 530 nm for carotenoids. CONCLUSION Optical reflectance spectroscopy shows potential as a tool for the estimation of functional components in the leaves of Chinese cabbage. The results of the present study provide useful information for the design and application of sensors with respect to on-site quantification of the functional components.

LONGIFOLIA LAM)	FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN			English	Article						Lactuca saliva L.; light quality; phenolics; antioxidant; controlled environment	LEAF LETTUCE; GROWTH; QUALITY; IRRADIATION; LEAVES; BLUE	This research evaluated the influence of light intensity and quality in the concentration of antioxidant compounds during the production cycle of cultivated romaine lettuce under a plant-factory system. Three treatments were tested: T1 = 127.49 (red and blue), T2 = 147.32 (red and blue) and T3 = 235.69 (red, blue and supplemented white light) mu mol/m(2)/s, respectively. The recorded variables were total concentration of phenols (TP), flavonoids (TF), non-flavonoid compounds (TNF), as well as antioxidant capacity by DPPH and ABTS assays. Results showed significant statistical differences among treatments and sampling events: T2 caused the highest concentration in all the variables. The concentration of antioxidant compounds in T1 and T3 was statistically equal (p <= 0.05). The content of total phenolics, total flavonoids and total non-flavonoids evaluated in romaine lettuce depend mainly on the incident light spectra (red and blue), which allows promotion of a significant increase (p <= 0.05) in concentration of 34.9, 47.9 and 29.2 %, respectively. Additionally, the red and blue light spectra in a to 3:1 ratio increase the concentration of phenolic compounds, as well as their antioxidant capacity (p <= 0.05).

Developing new cultivation methods for year-round blueberry production is desired to reduce off-season blueberry imports at a high price. Consulting with previous studies about influences of environmental factors on plants, the current study was carried out to investigate flowering characteristics, plant morphology, and potential for year-round high quality blueberry production under different light quality in a plant factory. Materials and methods - Blueberry plants cvs. 'Misty' and 'Sharpblue' were grown in light emitting diodes (LED) chambers installed with LED of 100% blue (459 nm), 100% red (631 nm), a mixture of 1:1 = red:blue light (a mixture of LED lights). Fluorescent light was used as control. Results and discussion - Cumulative flower number was maximum in 'Misty' under blue LED light and in 'Sharpblue under a mixture of LED lights. In Sharpblue, red LED light encouraged vegetative growth, and plants under blue light were delayed in growth with cessation of shoot elongation. However, a mixture of LED lights and fluorescent ones showed desirable vegetative growth and high potential for continuous flowering. In terms of fruit quality, higher soluble solid content (SSC) and less titratable acidity (TA) were found in fruits under blue LED light and a mixture of LED lights. Bigger fruits were found in plants under a mixture of LED lights and control but comparatively less SSC was found under control. Conclusion - Light quality has been shown to have a strong influence on flowering characteristics, plant morphology, and year-round high quality blueberry production in a plant factory.	[Cho, H.

Mother cladodes were cultivated under a deep-flow hydroponic culture system and irradiated with red or blue light alone or in combination (in the ratio 1:3 or 3:1) in an enclosed-type plant factory. Daughter cladodes developed from mother cladodes in all treatments. The rate of elongation of first cladodes was lower under blue light and the combination of red and blue light (in the ratio 1:3) compared with other treatments. The number of daughter cladodes was also low under blue light. Thus, compared with red light, blue light appears to suppress daughter cladode development. However, the width of daughter cladodes was higher under blue light and the combination of red and blue light (in the ratio 1:3) compared with other treatments. Total fresh weight (FW) of daughter cladodes emerging from one mother cladode was lowest under blue light and high under combined red and blue light (1:3 and 3:1). The number of spines, an undesirable characteristic of edible cacti, was significantly higher under both combinations of red and blue light (1:3 and 3:1) compared to other treatments. On the other hand, the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity of extracts of the daughter cladodes was highest under blue light or under combined red and blue light (1:3). Our results show that light wavelength strongly affects daughter cladode growth and development. Thus, controlling the lighting environment is effective for improving growth and quality in edible cacti.

Three-week-old seedlings were transplanted into subirrigation systems in a plant factory (average of 23 degrees C air temperature, 60% relative humidity, 170 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1) photosynthetic photon flux density, 12 h photoperiod, and 1,000 mu mol.mol(-1) CO2) equipped with fluorescent lamps (FL, control); monochromatic red (R, 654 nm), green (G, 518 nm), and blue (B, 455 nm) light-emitting diodes (LEDs); and various combinations of R and B (R:B = 6:4, 7:3, 8:2, 9:1), or RB with G (R:G:B = 5:1:4, 6:1:3, 7:1:2, 8:1:1, 9:1:0) LEDs. Shoot fresh weight was higher in the R8B2, R7B3, and R8G1B1 treatments, but did not significantly differ from that in the control. Root fresh weight was highest in the R8G1B1 treatment among all treatments. Leaf area showed a similar trend to shoot fresh weight. The specific leaf weight increased as the ratio of B LEDs increased under the RB and RGB treatments, except in the R8G1B1 treatment. Plants in the RGB treatments with 5 - 6% G light had a higher photosynthetic rate when compared with the RB treatments. The total phenolic content based on unit grams in plants irradiated with RB and RGB LEDs did not show a significant difference except in the R9G1B0 treatment. Antioxidant capacity per unit dry weight tended to increase as the ratio of B LEDs increased in the RB treatments. Regarding total phenolic content and antioxidant capacity per plant, the highest values were recorded in treatments R8B2, R7B3, and R8G1B1, which was similar to the shoot growth results. These results indicate that LEDs with R8B2, R7B3, and R8G1B1 ratios, as well as FL, are suitable visible lighting sources for producing high-value ice plants in plant factories.

For this purpose, red (R), blue (B), fluorescent lamp (FL, control), along with combined red and blue (R: B) LEDs were used. Interestingly, the plant growth parameters such as number of leaf, longest root, width of leaf, width of stomata, width of trichome, leaf area, leaf or root fresh weight (FW), weight (DW) as well as length of trichome were maximum under R:B (8:2), and significantly larger than control plants. The stomatal conductance or anthocyanin was maximum under B LED than those under FL, however the photosynthesis rate was greater under FL. RuBisCO activity was maximum under R:B (1:1) LEDs while the quantity of the UV absorbing substances was highest under R LED than under FL. The maximum amount of cardenolides were obtained from leaf tissue under R:B (2:8) LED than those under FL. The R:B LEDs light was suitable for Digitalis plant growth, development, micro- and macro-elements, as well as cardenolides accumulation in the plant factory system. The adaptation of the growth strategy developed in this study would be useful for the production of optimized secondary metabolites in Digitalis spp.	[Verma, Sandeep Kumar; Jeong, Byoung Ryong; Hwang, Seung Jae] Gyeongsang Natl Univ, Dept Agr Plant Sci, Coll Agr & Life Sci, Jinju 52828, South Korea; [Verma, Sandeep Kumar; Jeong, Byoung Ryong; Hwang, Seung Jae] Gyeongsang Natl Univ, Inst Agr & Life Sci, Jinju 52828, South Korea; [Gantait, Saikat] Bidhan Chandra Krishi Viswavidyalaya, Res Directorate, Crop Res Unit, Nadia 741252, W Bengal, India; [Gantait, Saikat] Bidhan Chandra Krishi Viswavidyalaya, Fac Agr, Dept Genet & Plant Breeding, Nadia 741252, W Bengal, India; [Jeong, Byoung Ryong; Hwang, Seung Jae] Gyeongsang Natl Univ, Grad Sch, Div Appl Life Sci BK21 Plus, Jinju 52828, South Korea; [Jeong, Byoung Ryong; Hwang, Seung Jae] Gyeongsang Natl Univ, Life Sci Res Inst, Jinju 52828, South Korea; [Verma, Sandeep Kumar] Bolu Abant Izeet Baysal Univ, Dept Biol, Biotechnol Lab, TR-14030 Bolu, Turkey		Verma, SK; Hwang, SJ (corresponding author), Gyeongsang Natl Univ, Dept Agr Plant Sci, Coll Agr & Life Sci, Jinju 52828, South Korea.; Verma, SK; Hwang, SJ (corresponding author), Gyeongsang Natl Univ, Inst Agr & Life Sci, Jinju 52828, South Korea.; Hwang, SJ (corresponding author), Gyeongsang Natl Univ, Grad Sch, Div Appl Life Sci BK21 Plus, Jinju 52828, South Korea.; Hwang, SJ (corresponding author), Gyeongsang Natl Univ, Life Sci Res Inst, Jinju 52828, South Korea.	sandeep.20j@gmail.com; hsj@gnu.ac.kr	Gantait, Saikat/L-7422-2016; Jeong, Byoung Ryong/D-7667-2014	Gantait, Saikat/0000-0001-5059-2428; Jeong, Byoung Ryong/0000-0002-4146-7278; Verma, Sandeep Kumar/0000-0002-9324-747X	"Cooperative Research Program for Agriculture Science & Technology Development" Rural Development Administration, Republic of Korea [PJ012773012018]	"Cooperative Research Program for Agriculture Science & Technology Development" Rural Development Administration, Republic of Korea(Rural Development Administration (RDA), Republic of Korea)	This work was carried out with the support of "Cooperative Research Program for Agriculture Science & Technology Development (Project No. PJ012773012018)" Rural Development Administration, Republic of Korea.		66	19	20	6	23	NATURE PORTFOLIO	BERLIN	HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY	2045-2322			SCI REP-UK	Sci Rep	DEC 20	2018	8								18009	10.1038/s41598-018-36113-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-36113-9			12	Multidisciplinary Sciences	Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)	Science & Technology - Other Topics	HF0FX	30573772	gold, Green Published			2022-11-14	WOS:000453836200015

In a plant factory with full electric lighting, if the spectrum is incorrect, then red leaf lettuce will have incomplete coloration. This study aimed to establish a light recipe for the mass production of red leaf lettuce using electric light sources in a plant factory by using indicators for quantitative assessment, including energy yield (EY) [grams of fresh weight (FW) harvested per kilowatt hour of electricity input for lighting], photon yield (PY) (grams of FW harvested per mole of photons delivered), anthocyanin yield per kilowatt hour (EYA), and anthocyanin yield per photon (PYA). First, the effects of four types of light quality on FW and anthocyanin content were examined. Then, two types of light quality, light-emitting diode with a red-to-blue photon ratio of 80:20 (R-80:B-20) and R-20:B-80, were selected for an experiment involving five treatments. An optimum light recipe (SR5SB1) including R-80:B-20 treatment during the early stage of cultivation (weeks 1 through 5 after sowing) followed by R-20:B-80 treatment during the final stage (week 6) was proposed. The SR5SB1 treatment led to FW, EYA, and PYA of 87.8 g/plant, 1.63 mg/kWh, and 0.57 mg.mol(-1), respectively. This treatment resulted in the highest EYA and PYA, with 159% and 256% more anthocyanin productivity, respectively, compared with cool white treatment (with FW, EYA, and PYA of 65.8 g/plant, 0.63 mg/kWh, and 0.16 mg.mol(-1), respectively). The proposed SR5SB1 light recipe enabled cultivation of red leaf lettuce with a balanced yield and anthocyanin production.

Intensive research has been performed to elucidate the effects of light intensity and wavelength on plant growth and nutritional quality with the use of light-emitting diodes (LEDs). In particular, the effects of monochromatic red, blue, or simultaneous red + blue light have been studied because these wavelengths are predominantly used for photosynthesis. We examined the effects of alternating red and blue light provided by LEDs over a period of 24 hours on the growth and nutritional properties of leafy lettuce. The results clearly show that alternating red and blue light accelerated plant growth significantly compared with white fluorescent lamps or red and blue LEDs at the same daily light integral. Plants grown under alternating red/blue light had a greater net assimilation rate and total and projected leaf area (an indicator of the fraction of leaf area that absorbs more light) than other plants. Additionally, alternating red and blue light maintained high concentrations of sugars, ascorbic acid, and anthocyanins in leaves. Taken together, the results indicate that continuous irradiation with alternating red and blue light could enhance growth while maintaining the nutritional quality in lettuce.

The objective of this study was to determine the effects of plasma lighting on tomato plant growth, photosynthetic characteristics, flowering rate, and physiological disorders. Tomato plants were grown in growth chambers at air temperatures of 25/23 degrees C (light/dark period), in a 16hday(-1) light period provided by four different light sources: 1kW and 700W sulfur plasma lights (1 SPL and 0.7 SPL), 1kW indium bromide plasma light, and 700W high pressure sodium lamp (0.7 HPS) as a control. The total dry weight and leaf area at 0.7 SPL were approximately 1.2 and 1.3 times greater, respectively, than that of 0.7 HPS at the 62days after sowing (DAS). The maximum light assimilation rate was observed at 1 SPL at the 73 DAS. In addition, the light compensation and saturation points of the plants treated with plasma lighting were 98.5% higher compared with HPS. Those differences appeared to be related to more efficient light interception, provided by the SPL spectrum. The percentage of flowering at 0.7 SPL was 30.5%, which was higher than that at 0.7 HPS; however, there were some instances of severe blossom end rot. Results indicate that plasma lighting promotes tomato growth, flowering, and photosynthesis. Therefore, a plasma lighting system may be a valuable supplemental light source in a greenhouse or plant factory.

This study aimed to comparatively determine the effects of UV-A, UV-B, and UV-Clamps or light-emitting diodes (LEDs) on the growth of dropwort (Oenanthe stolonifera) plants, and their contents of bioactive compounds. Dropwort seedlings with 2-3 offshoots were transplanted in a plant factory equipped with white LED and deep flow technique systems, and cultivated under standard growth conditions for 36days. Thereafter, the dropwort plants were supplementally exposed to one of five UV treatments with energy equivalent to 10Wm(-2): UV-C lamps for 2days, UV-B lamps for 3days, and UV-A lamps and LEDs with 370nm or 385nm peak wavelengths for 14days. The variable fluorescence (Fv) to maximum fluorescence (Fm) ratio (Fv/Fm) of dropwort leaves began to significantly decrease 3h after exposure to UV-C, and 6h after UV-B exposure. Fluorescence in UV-C and UV-B-treated plants was lower than in control and UV-A-treated plants during the entire period of UV irradiation. The fresh weight of the shoots of plants treated with UV was not significantly different to those of the control plants during the entire UV irradiation period. The total phenolic content of dropwort shoots exposed to UV-A and UV-B treatments significantly increased compared to that of the control 1day after treatment. The total phenolic content was highest in plants treated with the 370nm UV-A LED, and this was significantly higher (33%) than the control. Plants treated with the 385nm UV-A LED on day 3 of treatment had the highest total phenolic content compared to the other treatments. A similar trend was observed in contents of flavonoids and persicarin. UVlight induced higher anthocyanin content than the control. The activity of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase after UV treatments was significantly higher than the control, supporting the findings of our bioactive compound assays. In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that irradiating vegetables with UV-A LEDs would be useful in plant factories with artificial light for improving vegetable quality without inhibiting growth.

A high zinc concentration in the nutrient solution led to greatly increased leaf zinc concentration, but also decreased fresh and dry weights of shoots. In addition, necrosis was observed in leaves at a zinc concentration in the nutrient solution of >= 0.15 mM. By contrast, high wind speed and root zone temperature led to increases in leaf zinc concentration, but slightly decreased fresh and dry weights of shoots. In addition, under high wind speed and root zone temperature, no leaf necrosis was observed. The increase in leaf zinc concentration was attributed to increases in zinc absorption, accompanied by increased transpiration, because water absorption rates increased with wind speed and root zone temperature. Therefore, baby leaf red oak lettuce with high leaf zinc concentration can be produced by increasing wind speed and root zone temperature.

J	Urschel, MR; Pocock, T				Urschel, Matthew R.; Pocock, Tessa			Remote Detection of Growth Dynamics in Red Lettuce Using a Novel Chlorophyll a Fluorometer	AGRONOMY-BASEL			English	Article						chlorophyll fluorescence; controlled environment agriculture; crop growth; crop modeling; relative growth rates; remote sensing; light emitting diodes	FLUORESCENCE; LIGHT; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; SYSTEM; BIAS	The production of food crops in controlled environment agriculture (CEA) can help mitigate food insecurity that may result from increasingly frequent and severe weather events in agricultural areas. Lighting is an absolute requirement for crop growth in CEA, and is undergoing rapid advances with the advent of tunable, light emitting diode (LED) systems. The integration of these systems into existing CEA environmental control architectures is in its infancy and would benefit from a non-invasive, rapid, real-time, remote sensor that could track crop growth under different lighting regimes. A newly-developed remote chlorophyll a fluorescence (ChlF) sensing device is described herein that provides direct, remote, real-time physiological data collection for integration into tunable LED lighting control systems, thereby enabling better control of crop growth and energy efficiency. Data collected by this device can be used to accurately model growth of red lettuce plants. In addition to monitoring growth, this system can predict relative growth rates (RGR), net assimilation rates (NAR), plant area (PA), and leaf area ratio (LAR).

We evaluated the effects of light quality, light intensity, and photoperiod on the growth and yield of cherry radish grown under red plus blue LEDs in a controlled environment. Radish plants were cultivated under two light qualities with different red:blue ratios (1R:1B, 2R:1B) at three light intensities (180, 240, 300 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) or two photoperiods (12 h/12 h, 16 h/8 h), respectively. The light quality 2R:1B increased root diameter, root volume, and the biomass of shoot and root compared to light quality 1R:1B under a light intensity of 240 and 300 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), but the growth differences between 1R:1B and 2R:1B were significant when the light intensity was 240 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). New leaf chlorophyll content, root growth indices and the root-shoot ratio increased with light intensity. Cherry radish only formed storage roots with commercial value when light intensity was equal to or over 240 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). The root diameter, root volume, root-shoot ratio, and the biomass of shoot and root of plants grown in the 2R:1B treatment was significantly higher than those in the 1R:1B treatment under the 16 h/8 h photoperiod. However, no significant difference was observed in the 12 h/12 h photoperiod. These results indicated that light regime in combination with a light intensity between 240 and 300 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), the light quality 2R:1B, and a 16 h/8 h photoperiod produced appropriate growth of cherry radish in plant factory settings using an LED light source. In conclusion, the production of commercial storage roots in cherry radish is primarily dependent on light intensity, followed by light quality and photoperiod. Furthermore, the effectiveness of light quality regulation of storage roots was highly depended on light intensity and photoperiod.

The results showed that compared with the white light, the purple light, blue light, red light, and the red-blue light combination could all increase the biomass of the aboveground part of lettuce to various degrees, while green light and yellow light inhibited lettuce growth. Under blue light, the contents of soluble protein and flavonoid in lettuce were the highest; under red light, the soluble sugar content was the highest, while the contents of soluble protein, free amino acids, and vitamin C (VC) were relatively higher under the 4R/1B light condition. Compared with white light, the sources of purple, blue, and red lights as well as the red-blue light combination all significantly reduced nitrate accumulation in lettuce, and the activities of the nitrogen (N) metabolism-related enzymes such as nitrate reductase, nitrite reductase, glutamine synthetase, glutamate synthase, and glutamate dehydrogenase were increased to varying degrees. In contrast, the contents of nitrate and ammonium N were significantly accumulated in lettuce under green light, and the activities of relative enzymes were significantly reduced. Therefore, the purple light, blue light, and red-blue combination light sources could promote N assimilation and improve the aboveground biomass accumulation in lettuce by improving the activity of the N metabolism-related enzymes in lettuce. Particularly under the 4R/1B light source, the biomass, soluble protein, VC, and total amino acid content were rather high in lettuce, which indicated that the 4R/1B light source could better effectively improve the nutritional quality and promote the growth of lettuce, while yellow light and green light are not suitable to serve as direct sources in a plant factory. These results provide a certain theoretical basis for the regulation of the light environment in cultivation facilities.

Rupr) has potential benefits for human health, and its content is affected by growth conditions. In this study, we used a statistical model to identify the relationship between glucosinolate content and growth conditions, and to predict glucosinolate content in Chinese cabbage. RESULTMultiple regression analysis was employed to develop the model's growth condition parameters of growing period, temperature, humidity and glucosinolate content measured in Chinese cabbage grown in a plant factory. The developed model was represented by a second-order multi-polynomial equation with two independent parameters: growth duration and temperature (adjusted R-2=0.81), and accurately predicted glucosinolate content after 14days of seeding. CONCLUSIONTo our knowledge, this study presents the first statistical model for evaluating glucosinolate content, suggesting a useful methodology for designing glucosinolate-related experiments, and optimizing glucosinolate content in Chinese cabbage cultivation.

Butterhead lettuce plants were grown with nutrient solutions of various concentrations, which were maintained according to electrical conductivity (EC) throughout the cultivation period. Under these conditions, growth in nutrient solutions with lower EC led to slight decreases in nitrate concentrations in leaves, but also decreased fresh and dry weights of shoots, leading to the risk of a yield loss under EC control management (ECM). By contrast, when total nitrate requirement was supplied only at the start of cultivation, nitrate concentrations in leaves were decreased significantly with only slightly reduced plant growth. Hence, marketable-sized butterhead lettuces with lower nitrate concentrations can be produced by supplying total nitrate requirements in the nutrient solution at the start of cultivation.

The quality of vegetables grown in plant factories under hydroponic cultivation, e.g., their sweetness and softness, can be improved by controlling growth factors including the temperature, humidity, light source, and fertilizer. However, soil is cheaper than hydroponic cultivation and the visual phenotype of vegetables grown under the two conditions is different. As it is not clear whether their metabolite composition is also different, we studied leaf lettuce raised under the hydroponic condition in practical plant factory and strictly controlled soil condition. We chose two representative cultivars, "black rose" (BR) and "red fire" (RF) because they are of high economic value. Metabolite profiling by comprehensive gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) resulted in the annotation of 101 metabolites from 223 peaks detected by GC-MS; LC-MS yielded 95 peaks. The principal component analysis (PCA) scatter plot showed that the most distinct separation patterns on the first principal component (PC1) coincided with differences in the cultivation methods. There were no clear separations related to cultivar differences in the plot. PC1 loading revealed the discriminant metabolites for each cultivation method. The level of amino acids such as lysine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and valine was significantly increased in hydroponically grown leaf lettuce, while soil-cultivation derived leaf lettuce samples contained significantly higher levels of fatty-acid derived alcohols (tetracosanol and hexacosanol) and lettuce-specific sesquiterpene lactones (lactucopicrin-15-oxalate and 15-deoxylactucin-8-sulfate). These findings suggest that the metabolite composition of leaf lettuce is primarily affected by its cultivation condition. As the discriminant metabolites reveal important factors that contribute to the nutritional value and taste characteristics of leaf lettuce, we performed comprehensive metabolite profiling to identify metabolite compositions, i.e., metabolite signature, that directly improve its quality and value.

In an attempt to explore the influence of different spectral wavebands on leaf lettuce growth and development, a new way of light treatment with turning off the specific narrow-wavebands from the wide spectrum was established. And leaf lettuce was cultivated under different light spectra with the spectral wavebands of green (LG), yellow (LY) and purple (LP) "knockout" respectively in controllable environment. Then changes in biomass, morphological indexes, photosynthetic gas exchange, chlorophyll content and soluble sugar content of lettuce were examined. Our results revealed that, compared with plants grown under wide-spectral LED light (CK), LG treatment showed significantly reduction of fresh shoot weight at 25 days after planting (DAP) comparing to CK. LY and LP obtained obviously higher fresh shoot weight and moisture content at 15 DAP, in contrast, significantly lower ratio of root to shoot than CK. And A/Ci in LG were significantly reduced by about 33.3% and 36.1% at 20 DAP and 25 DAP respectively compared with CK. In addition, LY showed significant increases in soluble sugar content compared to other treatments at three sampling stages, while the lowest values were obtained in CK. These results indicated that green, yellow and purple light had significant regulations on the biomass, photosynthesis and soluble sugar content in lettuce, depending on the different growth period.

Obtaining high-quality seedlings using controlled irradiation from LEDs is critical, as the seedling health affects the growth and yield of leaf lettuce after transplantation. Because key molecular pathways underlying plant responses to a specific light quality and intensity remain poorly characterised, we used a multi-omics-based approach to evaluate the metabolic and transcriptional reprogramming of leaf lettuce seedlings grown under narrow-band LED lighting. Four types of monochromatic LEDs (one blue, two green and one red) and white fluorescent light (control) were used at low and high intensities (100 and 300 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1), respectively). Multi-platform mass spectrometry-based metabolomics and RNA-Seq were used to determine changes in the metabolome and transcriptome of lettuce plants in response to different light qualities and intensities. Metabolic pathway analysis revealed distinct regulatory mechanisms involved in flavonoid and phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathways under blue and green wavelengths. Taken together, these data suggest that the energy transmitted by green light is effective in creating a balance between biomass production and the production of secondary metabolites involved in plant defence.

Responses of Sweet Basil to Different Daily Light Integrals in Photosynthesis, Morphology, Yield, and Nutritional Quality	HORTSCIENCE			English	Article							ESSENTIAL OIL COMPOSITION; CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE; SHADE LEAVES; OCIMUM; GROWTH; L.; ACCUMULATION; RADIATION; SUN; ENVIRONMENTS	Consumption of basil (Ocimum basilicum) has been increasing worldwide in recent years because of its unique aromatic flavor and relatively high concentration of phenolics. To achieve a stable and reliable supply of basil, more growers are turning to indoor controlled-environment production with artificial lighting due to its high environmental controllability and sustainability. However, electricity cost for lighting is a major limiting factor to the commercial application of indoor vertical farming, and little information is available on the minimum light requirement to produce uniform and high-quality sweet basil. To determine the optimal daily light integral (DLI) for sweet basil production in indoor vertical farming, this study investigated the effects of five DLIs, namely, 9.3, 11.5, 12.9, 16.5, and 17.8 mol.m(-2).d(-1) on basil growth and quality. 'Improved Genovese Compact' sweet basil was treated with five DLIs provided by white fluorescent lamps (FLs) for 21 d after germination, and gas exchange rate, growth, yield, and nutritional quality of basil plants were measured to evaluate the effects of the different DLIs on basil growth and quality. Results indicated that basil plants grown under higher DLIs of 12.9, 16.5, or 17.8 mol.m(-2).d(-1) had higher net photosynthesis, transpiration, and stomatal conductance (gS), compared with those under lower DLIs of 9.3 and 11.5 mol.m(-2).d(-1). High DLIs resulted in lower chlorophyll (Chl) a+b concentration per leaf fresh weight (FW), higher Chl a/b ratios, and larger and thicker leaves of basil plants. The shoot FW under DLIs of 12.9, 16.5, and 17.8 mol.m(-2).d(-1) was 54.2%, 78.6%, and 77.9%, respectively, higher than that at a DLI of 9.3 mol.m(-2).d(-1). In addition, higher DLIs led to higher soluble sugar percent and dry matter percent than lower DLIs. The amounts of total anthocyanin, phenolics, and flavonoids per plant of sweet basil were also positively correlated to DLIs, and antioxidant capacity at a DLI of 17.8 mol.m(-2).d(-1) was 73% higher than that at a DLI of 9.3 mol.m(-2).d(-1). Combining the results of growth, yield, and nutritional quality of sweet basil, we suggest a DLI of 12.9 mol.m(-2).d(-1) for sweet basil commercial production in indoor vertical farming to minimize the energy cost while maintaining a high yield and nutritional quality.

When runner tips with unfolded bracts were fixed on a growing medium to generate runner plants, the first true leaf, a runner, and roots of the runner plants appeared 6-10 days after fixing the runner tips (DAF), and their shoot and root dry weights significantly increased 6 and 10 DAF, respectively. The top/root ratio was the greatest 10 DAF. The net photosynthetic rate of runner plants 9, 11, and 13 DAF decreased after separation, while that at 15, 17, and 19 DAF did not. The runner plants separated from their stock plants 15, 20, and 25 DAF were successfully grown until 30 DAF; however, those 10 DAF was not. At 30 DAF, the root dry weight of the runner plants separated from the stock plants 15 DAF was smaller than that of the runner plants separated 20, 25, and 30 DAF, whereas the dry weights of leaves and runners were not significantly different. The use of small stock plants could reduce the required timescale from placing stock plants to produce new runner plants, but there was no significant difference in the timescales when the runner plants were separated 15 or 20 DAF due to the relatively insufficient growth of runner plants separated 15 DAF. These results indicate that runner plants separated 20 DAF, with two true leaves and a 5-mm crown diameter, would be suitable stock plants for the autotrophic transplant propagation method in a T-PFAL for strawberry propagation.

We speculated that treatment of kale (Brassica oleracea) grown in a plant factory with NaCl, Na2SeO3, or both would increase the bioactive phytochemical levels including glucosinolates (GLSs) and isothiocyanates (ITCs), the key molecules in cancer prevention. The kale was harvested and analysed after treatment with NaCl and Na(2)SeO(3)alone or in combination for 1 or 2 weeks. Exposure to NaCl alone but not Na2SeO3 increased plant root growth. Levels of sinigrin were increased by a 2-week exposure to Na2SeO3 alone or in combination with NaCl, whereas no changes were observed in glucoraphanin and gluconasturtiin gluconasturtiin levels. Importantly, the ITC concentration was affected by 2-week treatment with both compounds. To evaluate the bioactivity of kale, HepG2 human hepatoma cells were treated with plant extract for 6 h. Only the extract of kale roots exposed to a combination NaCl and Na2SeO3 for 2 weeks showed an increased expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2), which regulates genes encoding antioxidant proteins. These data suggest that co-treatment with NaCl and Na2SeO3 increased the ITC content and chemopreventive effects of kale root.

However, high initial investment and operation costs are restricting the wide application of this technology. In order to design an optimal artificial lighting environment for lettuce production, effects of different combinations of light intensity, photoperiod, and light quality on growth, quality, photosynthesis, and energy use efficiency of lettuce (Lactuca sativa L. cv Ziwei) were investigated under a closed plant factory. Lettuce transplants were grown under photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) at 150 mu mol/m(2).s, 200 mu mol/m(2).s, 250 mu mol/m(2).s, and 300 mu mol/m(2).s provided by fluorescent lamps (FL) with a red to blue ratio (R:B ratio) of 1.8 and light-emitting diode (LED) lamps with R: B ratio of 1.2 and 2.2, in combination with photoperiod of 12 and 16 h/d. In order to examine the "long term" photosynthetic characteristics, net photosynthetic rates of hydroponic lettuce leaves were continuously measured for 2 days (15th and 16th day after transplanting) before harvest. There was no difference in leaf fresh weight (FW) between PPFD of 250 mu mol/m(2).s and 300 mu mol/m(2).s with photoperiod of 16 h/d, regardless of light quality, and same results showed in contents of nitrate, soluble sugar, and vitamin C, respectively. The results of continuous measurements of net photosynthetic rate of lettuce leaves before harvest indicated that plants grown at PPFD of 250 mu mol/m(2).s had consistently higher compared to those grown at PPFD of 300 mu mol/m(2).s. Combining the results from growth, photosynthesis, quality, and energy consumption, it can be concluded that PPFD at 250 mu mol/m(2).s with photoperiod of 16 h/d under LED with R: B ratio of 2.2 is a suitable light environment for maximum growth and high quality of commercial lettuce (cv. Ziwei) production under indoor controlled environment.

In addition, this study was conducted to examine the effect of different intensities of LED mixed light on the growth of lettuce in a closed-type plant factory. The prediction models of lettuce growth data (shoot fresh weight, shoot dry weight, and leaf area) were developed using the correlation between growth data and the number of pixels on an acquired image. Also, SPAD value prediction models were developed using the correlation between the reflectance of a lettuce leaf in an acquired multi-spectral image and the measured SPAD value of the lettuce leaf The characteristics of lettuce growth according to the light intensity in a closed-type plant factory was conducted under light intensities of 100, 150, and 200 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1). At 200 mu mol.s(-1) light intensity, the shoot fresh weight increased about 27.37-73.93% when compared to 100 and 150 mu mo1.m(-2).s(-1) on 20 days after sowing. The shoot dry weight showed a similar tendency. Lettuce leaf area increased by 6.89-52.52% on 20 days after sowing when compared to plants grown under 100 and 150 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1). At a light intensity of 200 mu mol.m(-2)s(-1), the SPAD value increased about 3.56-23.76% when compared to plants grown under 100 and 150 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1). Using prediction models based on the number of pixels on a lettuce leaf image, lettuce growth data (shoot fresh weight, shoot dry weight, and leaf area) can be predicted with high precision. In addition, the prediction models for SPAD value were developed using the vegetation indices NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), GNDVI (Green NDVI), NIR/Red ratio, NIR/Green ratio, and Red/Green ratio. The SPAD values were predicted with relatively high precision (R-2 = 0.834) using the prediction model based on NIR/Red.

The objective of this study was to determine the optimal concentration of culture nutrient solution for the production of carrot leaves in a closed-type plant factory. After sowing, seedlings at the two-true-leaf stage were transplanted to a growing bed system. Hydroponic cultivation was performed using a three-layer NFT system. Culture nutrient solutions were supplied at three electrical conductivity (EC) levels (2.0, 3.0, and 4.0 dS.m(-1)). Measurements of plant growth characteristics, including fresh weight, dry weight, plant height, and leaf area, were performed 14 and 23 days after planting. Differences in culture nutrient solution concentrations did not affect leaf number and chlorophyll content, and did not cause significant difference in antioxidant capacities and total phenol content of carrot plants. However, contents of total phenol, chlorogenic acid, and kaempferol were highest in plants grown in the EC 2.0 dS.m(-1) solution, whereas those grown in the EC 3.0 dS.m(-1) solution had the highest fresh and dry weights. Collectively, our results indicate that an EC 3.0 dS.m(-1) culture nutrient solution combined with a cultivation period of 20-25 days is optimal for the hydroponic cultivation of carrot leaves in a controlled environment. In addition, we found that carrot leaves contain antioxidant compounds and are thus suitable as a leaf vegetable.

'Sunmang'. Seedlings were grown in a 20 degrees C growth chamber with photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) of 253.67 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1) and a 12-h photoperiod for 18 days. The seedlings were then transplanted into pots containing a growing medium, followed by placement in growth chambers equipped with a combination of red (R), white (W), and blue (B) LEDs (R:W:B = 7:2:1) that provided pulsed irradiation at various frequencies (0.3, 1, 3, 10, and 30 kHz) at 75% duty ratio (PPFD 190 mu mol.m(-2). s(-1)). The control (continuous irradiation) was compared with the treatments 4 weeks after transplanting. Most growth parameters such as shoot fresh weight and leaf area under pulsed LEDs were similar to those of the control. Treatments with lower frequencies (0.3, 1, and 3 kHz) were more effective for growth even though the light intensity was lower than that in the control. No significant difference was observed in the maximum quantum yield of PSII and photosynthetic rates between the treatments. Macronutrient (K, Ca, and Mg) levels were significantly higher under all treatments compared to the control. Light use efficiency was the highest under irradiation with 1 kHz pulsed LEDs. In conclusion, pulsed LEDs with 75% duty ratio and low frequencies did not show significant inhibition on plant growth, suggesting that pulsed LED irradiation technology has a potential to save energy consumption for producing crops in plant factories.

'Jeokchima') according to the position of air anion treatment in a closed-type plant factory. The experimental conditions in the plant factory were as follows: fluorescent light with photoperiod of 16/8 h (light/dark), temperature of 20 +/- 2 degrees C and 50 +/- 5% relative humidity. The nutrient solutions had a pH of 6.0 +/- 0.5 and 1.8 +/- 0.2 dS.m(-1) electrical conductivity (EC). The plants were transplanted into the factory from a plastic bed and exposed to air anion treatment from three different positions (sideward, upward, and downward) for 4 weeks. The growth characteristics of lettuce (leaf length and width, shoot fresh weight and shoot dry weight, leaf area, chlorophyll content, antioxidant capacity, and total phenol content) were measured at 3 weeks and 4 weeks. After 4 weeks in the downward anion treatment, lettuce leaves were 14% longer and 21.5% wider than the leaves of the control plants. Furthermore, the shoot fresh weight of lettuce grown in the downward anion treatment was 37.1% greater than that of the control lettuce. Similar results were observed for shoot dry weight. Out of the 3 positions of anion generation, the downward position produced lettuces with the greatest leaf area The chlorophyll content of lettuce decreased during all of the anion treatments. The antioxidative activity and total phenol content of lettuce decreased during the downward anion treatment. These results imply that the optimum position of anion treatment for increasing lettuce production in closed-type plant factories is the downward position.

Dropwort plants with 2-3 offshoots were grown under three monochromatic LEDs:red (R; 654 nm), blue (B; 456 nm), and green (G; 518 nm), thirteen combinations of R and B (R:B = 9:1, 8:2, 7:3, and 6:4), RB with G (R:G:B = 9:1:0, 8:1:1, 7:1:2, and 6:1:3), and RB with white (W) (R:W:B = 8:2:0, 8:1:1, 7:2:1, 7:1:2, and 6:2:2) and fluorescent lamps (control) for 6 weeks. R LEDs improved growth characteristics, including plant height and fresh and dry weights of shoots. Combined LEDs with 70-80% red wavelength resulted in the highest values in fresh weight. The B LED treatment resulted in the highest total phenolic and anthocyanin content in dropwort leaves, which increased in the combined LEDs treatments as the proportion of blue wavelength increased. Further, the RWB treatments, regardless of the ratio, resulted in higher anthocyanin contents than that in the RB and RGB treatments. Persicarin content was also significantly higher in the B treatment than in the R and G treatments. However, compared to the RB treatments, persicarin content in the RGB and RWB treatments was decreased, on average, by 72 and 64%, respectively. We suggested that the light spectrum is closely related to the enhancement of growth and bioactive compounds. Our findings provide basic information for designing lighting systems in plant factories to improve the growth and bioactive compounds in dropwort.

Four alternating light treatments (R/B) had the same 8.64 mu mol m(-2) daily light integral (DLI) and similar R:B ratio (2:1), but different R/B alternating intervals that were respectively 8 h, 4 h, 2 h, and 1 h during a 16 h photoperiod. Two simultaneous light treatments, one of which (RB) had the same DLI and energy consumption with the alternating light treatments, while the other (RB') had the same photoperiod with the alternating light treatments were set up to compare the concurrently and alternately provided R and B. Results showed that different types of radiation led to obvious morphological changes, plants with simultaneous RB appeared the most sparse while those with RB' looked the most compact. Plant height/width and leaf length/width were all the highest under R/B (8 h) followed by R/B (1 h). Lettuce biomass under RB' was significantly higher than others, more than twice that under RB, R/B (4 h) and R/B (2 h), but less than twice that under R/B (8 h) and R/B (1 h). RB' significantly decreased the soluble sugar content by 9%-32% while increased crude fiber content by 14%-39% compared with others. Significantly higher ascorbic acid content as well as lower nitrate content were detected in lettuce under R/B (4 h) and R/B (2 h), while significantly lower ascorbic acid content as well as higher nitrate content were detected in lettuce under R/B (8 h) and R/B (1 h). In all, based on the same energy consumption, R/B (8 h) and R/B (1 h) resulted in higher yield, while R/B (4 h) and R/B (2 h) brought about higher nutritive value compared with the cocurrent light RB. Therefore, we conclude that lettuce growth and qualities can be purposely adjusted by adopting different alternating intervals of red and blue light. Meanwhile, the alternating modes will provide methods for deeply studying the relationship of red and blue light when acting on plants.

Three-week-old C. denticulatum seedlings were transplanted to a hydroponic system in a plant factory equipped with R, B, and FR LEDs. The ratio of R to B LEDs was set at 8:2 (R8B2), and the ratio of R to FR LEDs was adjusted to 0.7, 1.2, 4.1, and 8.6. R8B2 (without FR LEDs) and commercial LEDs were used as control I and II, respectively. The plants were cultivated under these light treatments, and some of the control plants were subjected to four different R/FR ratios for 30 min before the end of the light period (EOL). We measured growth characteristics, total phenolic contents, and the levels of individual phenolic compounds (chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, and chicoric acid) 6 weeks after treatment. Shoot fresh and dry weight, leaf area, leaf length, and leaf width under R/FR ratios of 0.7 and 1.2 were 1.8- to 2.4-times higher than those of the control plants. Continuous R/FR 0.7 and 1.2 irradiation reduced the total phenolic content per dry weight compared to the control, although this effect was not significant. The total phenolic content per plant under R/FR 0.7 and 1.2 increased more than 2-fold, and the shoot fresh weight increased 1.7- and 1.6-fold, compared to control I. Individual phenolic compound levels exhibited the same trends as total phenolic content. Under R/FR 0.7 and 1.2, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, and chicoric acid levels per shoot increased 1.3- to 1.8-fold compared to control I. FR EOL treatments did not have a significant effects on growth or the contents of bioactive compounds. These results suggest that supplemental irradiation with FR LEDs could be used to improve C. denticulatum growth and quality in terms of phytochemical composition when grown in a plant factory with artificial lighting.

To improve the growth of runner plants when strawberry transplants are produced in a plant factory, we conducted two experiments to investigate (1) the effect of different light intensity for stock and runner plants on the growth of runner plants, and (2) the effect of different container volume for runner plants on their growth. When the stock and runner plants were grown under nine different light conditions composed of three different light intensities (100, 200, and 400 mu mol.m(-2) .s(-1) PPF) for each stock and runner plants, increasing the light intensity for stock plants promoted the growth of runner plants, however, the growth of runner plants was not enhanced by increasing the light intensity for runner plants under same light intensity condition for stock plants. We also cultivated runner plants using plug trays with four different container volumes (21, 34, 73, and 150 mL) for 20 days after placing the stock plants, and found that using plug trays with lager container volume did not enhance the growth of runner plants. These results indicate that providing optimal condition for stock plants, rather than the runner plants, is more important for increasing the growth of the runner plants and that the efficiency of strawberry transplant production in a plant factory can be improved by decreasing light intensity or container volume for runner plants.

However, the high-density planting pattern in PFALs causes low light conditions in the lower canopy, leading to leaf senescence in the outer leaves and thus to reductions in plant yields. In the present study, the effect of supplemental upward lighting underneath the plants on photosynthetic characteristics and plant yield was examined in lettuce, in comparison with supplemental downward lighting from above the plants at the same light intensity. Supplemental upward lighting increased the curvature factor of the photosynthetic response to light from above the plants. Moreover, supplemental upward lighting significantly enhanced the lettuce yield by retarding the senescence of the outer leaves. Here, we propose a novel cultivation system with a combination of downward lighting and supplemental upward lighting that can effectively increase plant growth and yield in PFALs.

The quality of plants grown outdoors, however, is difficult to control. Myriad environmental factors influence plant growth and directly impact biosynthetic pathways, thus affecting the secondary metabolism of bioactive compounds. Plant factories use artificial lighting to increase the quality of medicinal plants and stabilize production. Photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) and electrical conductivity (EC) of nutrient solutions are two important factors that substantially influence perilla (Perilla frutescens, Labiatae) plant growth and quality. To identify suitable levels of PPFD and EC for perilla plants grown in a plant factory, the growth, photosynthesis, and accumulation of secondary metabolites in red and green perilla plants were measured at PPFD values of 100, 200, and 300 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) in nutrient solutions with EC values of 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 dS m(-1). The results showed significant interactive effects between PPFD and EC for both the fresh and dry weights of green perilla, but not for red perilla. The fresh and dry weights of shoots and leafy areas were affected more by EC than by PPFD in green perilla, whereas they were affected more by PPFD than by EC in red perilla. Leaf net photosynthetic rates were increased as PPFD increased in both perilla varieties, regardless of EC. The perillaldehyde concentration (mg g(-1)) in red perilla was unaffected by the treatments, but accumulation in plants (mg per plant) was significantly enhanced as the weight of dry leaves increased. Perillaldehyde concentrations in green perilla showed significant differences between combinations of the highest PPFD with the highest EC and the lowest PPFD with the lowest EC. Rosmarinic acid concentration (mg g(-1)) was increased in a combination of low EC and high PPFD conditions. Optimal cultivation conditions of red and green perilla in plant factory will be discussed in terms of plant growth and contents of medicinal ingredients.

J	Song, JX; Meng, QW; Du, WF; He, DX				Song Jinxiu; Meng Qingwu; Du Weifen; He Dongxian			Effects of light quality on growth and development of cucumber seedlings in controlled environment	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						blue light; chlorophyll; cucumber seedlings; controlled environment; gas exchange; green light; light-emitting diode; red light	EMITTING-DIODES LEDS; SUPPLEMENTAL BLUE; LEAF LETTUCE; GREEN LIGHT; RED; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; PHOTOMORPHOGENESIS; IMPROVES; SPINACH; RADISH	Conventional light sources have been successfully used to cultivate a wide variety of horticultural crops. However, they are of limited use due to uncontrollability of spectra and energy inefficiency. Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) emerged with tremendous potential in controlled environment agriculture due to their energy efficiency, longevity, and spectral specificity, but the effects of different types of LEDs on plant growth and development must be examined. In this study, cucumber (Cucumis sativus L. cv. Zhongnong 26) seedlings were grown under four different lighting treatments that each delivered a photosynthetic photon flux density of 200 mu mol/m(2).s at plant canopy including triphosphate fluorescent lamps (TF), high-frequency fluorescent lamps (HF), white LEDs (WL), and red and blue LEDs (RBL). Cucumber seedlings were grown in a growth chamber at (25.0 +/- 1.5)degrees C with 12-hour light and 12-hour dark for 30 days after sowing, and data were subsequently collected. Seedlings grown under the WL were 45%, 12%, and 40% taller than those grown under the TF, HF and RBL, respectively. The leaf area was 23% smaller under the TF than under the HF. The shoot dry weight was 16%-22% lower under the TF than under the other lighting treatments. The transplants grown under the RBL had the lowest root dry weight and root to shoot ratio. The seedling quality index was similar among all the lighting treatments. The LEDs treatment yielded more total dry weight with unit electric power compared to the fluorescent lamps. The chlorophyll content was 13%-15% higher in plants grown under the HF and WL than that under the TF and RBL. Plants grown under the WL and RBL had greater photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate, and stomatal conductance than those grown under the TF and HF. It was concluded that high quality cucumber seedlings can be efficiently produced under the broad-spectrum WL that emit a reasonable amount of blue, green and red light, and the lack of green light and/or high ratio of red to blue light under the RBL may cause undesired plant attributes.

J	Lee, JW; Kang, WH; Park, KS; Son, JE				Lee, Joon Woo; Kang, Woo Hyun; Park, Kyoung Sub; Son, Jung Eek			Spectral dependence of electrical energy-based photosynthetic efficiency at single leaf and canopy levels in green- and red-leaf lettuces	HORTICULTURE ENVIRONMENT AND BIOTECHNOLOGY			English	Article						leaf color; light conversion efficiency; light-emitting diode (LED); light penetration model; light quality	QUANTUM YIELD; LIGHT-DISTRIBUTION; GROWTH; LEAVES; PHOTOSYSTEMS; QUALITY	The spectrum of light affects both the electrical energy consumption by plants and photosynthetic efficiency. In a plant factory, where light-emitting diodes (LEDs) serve as an alternative to solar light, the optimal spectrum of light should be carefully chosen to maximize the rate of photosynthesis and the electrical energy efficiency of the crop. The objectives of this study were to investigate the photosynthetic rate of different colored lettuces (reddish and green leaves), to quantify the spectral dependence of photosynthetic efficiency, and to optimize the LED spectrum for maximum canopy photosynthesis and electrical energy consumption in lettuce grown in a plant factory. Two lettuce cultivars (Lactuca sativa L.), 'JeokChukMyeon' and 'CheongChukMyeon', were assessed for light absorption and photosynthetic efficiency at the single leaf and canopy levels, and the relative consumption of electrical energy from the LED lights was measured at 18 narrow wavelength bands of 10 nm from 400 to 700 nm. Anthocyanin and chlorophyll content (SPAD value) were measured and correlated with leaf color. Light interception by the canopy was estimated with light transmittance models. The light absorption was similar among the green and reddish lettuce cultivars at most wavelengths, but slightly higher in the reddish leaves around 550 nm (green region). In the reddish leaves, photosynthetic rates per incident photon of a single leaf had two peaks at 650-660 and 400-410 nm, while the photosynthetic rate per absorbed photon had three peaks at 650-660, 400-410, and 540-560 nm. In the green region of the light spectrum, both photosynthetic rates per incident photon and those per absorbed photon were lower in the reddish cultivars than in the green cultivars. The spectral dependence of light absorption at the canopy level was much weaker than that at the single leaf level. The quantum yield and absorption of green light at the canopy level were nearly same as those of blue and red lights, indicating that the photosynthetic efficiency of green light at the canopy level was higher than that at the single leaf level. The relative electrical energy consumption was lower in the green region than in the red and blue regions. Therefore, the photosynthetic efficiency based on electrical energy consumption at the canopy level was much lower with green LEDs than with blue or red LEDs. These results describe the plant response to the light spectrum at the canopy level and can be useful for optimizing artificial lighting sources for maximum plant productivity and energy-savings in a plant factory.

In the first experiment we evaluated the effect stem age on propagation success: mature stems - from already bloomed stems; and young stems - yet to bloom; and Nitrogen fertilizer application, from two sources: as Nitrate and Ammonium (respectively as Calcium Nitrate at concentrations of: 5.81 gL(-1); 11.61 gL(-1); 17.42 gL(-1); and Urea at concentrations of 2.00 gL(-1); 4.00 gL(-1) and 6.00 gL(-1) plus control treatments). We evaluated the following parameters: the number of cuttings stalks that launched shoots and/or roots, vigor, number of roots per plant and root length per plant. Factorial analysis of variance (stems age x source of Nitrogen; and age of stem x Nitrogen level) was applied using a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) approach. Where significant differences were observed, averages were compared using post-hoc tests (Tukey). Propagation success was higher using cuttings from mature stems (60.2%), a value 1.6 times higher than obtained with stem cuttings from young stems (38.0%). Application of Nitrogen, in both forms, did not influence any of the evaluated parameters. In the second experiment we treated cuttings from mature stems with Salicylic acid in 3 concentrations (0.10 mM; 0.50 mM; 1.00 mM and plus a control treatment). Evaluated parameters included proportion of cuttings stalks that launched shoots and/or roots, leaf length, root length, and number of roots per stem cutting. Factorial analysis of variance was applied with post-hoc tests. Application of 0.50 mM of Salicylic acid increased the proportion of cuttings stalks that launched shoots and/or roots by 20.5% relative to the control treatment.

'Sunmang') grown in a plant factory with electrical lighting. Lettuce seedlings were subjected to 12 light treatments combining five lighting sources: red (R; 655 nm), blue (B; 456 nm), and different ratios of red and blue light combined with three light-emitting diodes [LEDs (R9B1, R8B2, and R6B4)]. Treatments were divided into control (continuous irradiation of each light source for 4 weeks), monochromatic (changing from R to B at 1, 2, or 3 weeks after the onset of the experiments), and combined (changing from R9B1 to R8B2 or R6B4 at 2 or 3 weeks after the onset of the experiments). Growth and photosynthetic rates of lettuce increased with increasing ratios of red light, whereas chlorophyll and antioxidant phenolic content decreased with increasing ratios of red light. Individual phenolic compounds, including chlorogenic, caffeic, chicoric, and ferulic acids, and kaempferol, showed a similar trend to that of total phenolics. Moreover, transcript levels of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) and chalcone synthase (CHS) genes were rapidly upregulated by changing light quality from red to blue. Although the concentration of bioactive compounds in lettuce leaves enhanced with blue light, their contents per lettuce plant were more directly affected by red light, suggesting that biomass as well as bioactive compounds' accumulation should be considered to enhance phytochemical production. In addition, results suggested that growth and antioxidant phenolic compound synthesis were more sensitive to monochromatic light than to combined light variations. In conclusion, the adjustment of light quality at a specific growth stage should be considered as a strategic tool for improving crop yield, nutritional quality, or both in a plant factory with electrical lighting.

Green light enhances growth, photosynthetic pigments and CO2 assimilation efficiency of lettuce as revealed by 'knock out' of the 480-560 nm spectral waveband	PHOTOSYNTHETICA			English	Article						gas exchange; green light; leafy vegetable; light-response curve; pigment; PN/Ci curve; photosynthesis	GAS-EXCHANGE; STOMATAL CONDUCTANCE; QUANTUM YIELD; RED-LIGHT; ACCLIMATION; BLUE; LIMITATIONS; WAVELENGTH; DYNAMICS; QUALITY	Adding green component to growth light had a profound effect on biomass accumulation in lettuce. However, conflicting views on photosynthetic efficiency of green light, which have been reported, might occur due to nonuniform light sources used in previous studies. In an attempt to reveal plausible mechanisms underlying the differential photosynthetic and developmental responses to green light, we established a new way of light treatment modeled according to the principle of gene "knock out". Lettuce (Lactuca sativa L. var. youmaicai) was grown under two different light spectra, including a wide spectrum of light-emitting diode (LED) light (CK) and a wide spectrum LED light lacking green (480-560 nm) (LG). Total PPFD was approximately 100 A mu mol(photon) m(-2) s(-1) for each light source. As compared to lettuce grown under CK, shoot dry mass, photosynthetic pigment contents, total chlorophyll to carotenoids ratio, absorptance of PPFD, and CO2 assimilation showed a remarkable decrease under LG, although specific leaf area did not show significant difference. Furthermore, plants grown under LG showed significantly lower stomatal conductance, intercellular CO2 concentration, and transpiration compared with CK. The plants under CK exhibited significantly higher intrinsic quantum efficiency, respiration rate, saturation irradiance, and obviously lower compensation irradiance. Finally, we showed that the maximum ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate-saturated rate of carboxylation, the maximum rate of electron transport, and rate of triosephosphate utilization were significantly reduced by LG. These results highlighted the influence of green light on photosynthetic responses under the conditions used in this study. Adding green component (480-560 nm) to growth light affected biomass accumulation of lettuce in controllable environments, such as plant factory and Bioregenerative Life Support System.

The present study employed CE-MS to investigate the effects of high CO2, nutrient formulation, and LED on the accumulation of primary metabolites in head lettuce. Results suggested that high CO2 (1000 ppm) and nutrient supply enhanced both the biomass and some amino acids. Hierarchical clustering analysis was used to evaluate effects of red LED in combination with high CO2 and Hoagland's formulation; distinctive cluster formation contained 14 amino acids (mostly branched-chain and aromatic amino acids, histidine and arginine). Thus, simultaneous treatments of monochromatic LED, high CO2 and nutrient formulation improved the amino acids accumulation, and likely reduced the inorganic nitrogen sources in planta.

The typical mechanically stimulated phenotype is shorter and more compact than non-mechanically stimulated plants. This dwarfing effect can be employed to help conform crop plants to the constraints of spaceflight and vertical agriculture crop production systems. Capsicum annum (cv. California Wonder) plants were grown in controlled environment chambers and subjected to mechanical stimulation in the form of firm but gentle daily rubbing of internode tissue with a tightly wrapped cotton swab. Two studies were conducted, the first being a vegetative growth phase study in which plants were mechanically stimulated until anthesis. The second study carried the mechanical stimulation through to fruit set. The response during the vegetative growth experiment was consistent with other results in the literature, with a general reduction in all plant growth metrics and an increase in relative chlorophyll (SPAD) content under mechanical stimulation. In the fruiting phase study, only height and stem thickness differed from the control plants. Using the data from the fruiting study, a rudimentary calculation of volume use efficiency (VUE) improvements was conducted. Results suggest that VUE can be improved, particularly in terrestrial vertical agriculture systems that can take advantage of moderate height reductions by exploiting much greater vertical capacity in the production system. Mechanical stimulation can also improve VUE in spaceflight applications by reducing vertical system requirements or by expanding the species range that can be grown in a fixed production volume. Mechanical stimulation is also discussed as a microgravity countermeasure for crop plants.

We here investigated the effects of various combinations of light intensity (60,140 and 220 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) and nitrogen concentration (7,15 and 23 mmol L-1) of the solution on the growth, photosynthetic characteristics, vitamin C and nitrate content of lettuce. Our results demonstrate that the lettuce had the largest dry biomass at the high illumination of 220 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) and low nitrogen of 7 mmol L-1. The higher light and low nitrogen also contributed to the accumulation of vitamin C and decrease of nitrate in lettuce leaves. The effect of nitrogen supply on chlorophyll concentrations was more efficient under low light than high illumination. Our results reveal that there was an obvious interaction between light intensity and nitrogen available for the photosynthesis, yield and quality of lettuce. This study provides valuable insights into the combinational regulation of light intensity and nitrogen supply for improving growth and nutritional quality of vegetables grown in greenhouse and plant factory.

Hydroponic cultivation of Mentha spicata and comparison of biochemical and antioxidant activities with soil-grown plants	ACTA PHYSIOLOGIAE PLANTARUM			English	Article						Hydroponics; Mentha spicata; Antioxidant activity; Organic acids	RHIZOSPHERE; COMMUNITIES; DYNAMICS; EXTRACTS; STRESS; LUPIN	The development of controlled environment agriculture techniques such as hydroponics offers a viable alternative to obtain a high efficiency in water use and higher productivity in an environmentally sustainable way. A study was undertaken to assess the feasibility of growing Mentha spicata under hydroponic conditions and to compare its biochemical properties with that of soil-grown plants. The results confirmed that the productivity of M. spicata was higher in terms of crop biometric properties, yield and its influence on the biochemical properties. The per cent yield in M. spicata was 61% higher than the conventional soil farming. The antioxidant activity, enzyme activity and active compounds present in the plant extracts and presence of organic acids were higher in hydroponically grown plants when compared to the soilgrown plants. Similarly, the higher value of phenol and proline in soil-grown plants when compared to hydroponic plants indicated that the plants were subjected to some form of abiotic and biotic stress. Hence, it is suggested that the cultivation of these medicinal plants under hydroponic condition is a viable alternative in urban and peri-urban areas and avoids the problems that are characteristic in conventional cultivation of these plants.

The leaves and sprouts of quinoa can also be consumed either raw or cooked, providing considerably nutritional value as well as high antioxidant and anticancer activities. This study was carried out to obtain basic data to assist in the practical design of a plant factory with artificial lighting for the cultivation of quinoa as a leafy vegetable. We estimated the energy content of the quinoa and the electrical energy required to produce this crop. The yield was 1,000 plants per day, with a planting density and light intensity of 0.015 m(2) (15 x 10 cm) and 200 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1), respectively. The total number of plants, cultivation area, and electricity consumption were estimated to be 25,000, 375 m2, and 93,750 mu mol.s(-1), respectively. White fluorescent lamps were used at a power of 20.4 kW from 1,857 fluorescent lamps (FL, 55 W), and the cost for electricity was approximately 1,820 dollars (exchange rate of $1 = 1,200 won) per month. For a daily harvest of 1,000 plants per day in a closed plant factory, the estimated light installation cost, total installation cost, and total production cost would be 15,473, 46,421, and 55,704 dollars, respectively. The calculated production cost per plant, including labor costs, would be 27 cents for the 25-day cultivation period, with a marketable ratio of 80%. Considering the annual total expenses, income, and depreciation costs, the selling price per plant was estimated to be approximately 56 cents.

However, the absence of green light could be disadvantageous for crop production, as green light plays an important role in plant development. The objective of this study was to investigate whether adding green light to different proportions of red and blue light would affect the leaf photosynthetic rate, growth, and morphology of lettuce plants. Plants were transplanted and grown hydroponically for 25 days under different combinations of red, blue (0, 10, 20, and 30%), and green (0 and 10%) light at 150 +/- 15 mu molaEuro cent m(-2)aEuro cent s(-1) of photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD). The leaf photosynthetic rate was highest under 80% red and 20% blue light and decreased significantly with the addition of green light and the absence of blue light. As the fraction of blue light increased, leaf size and plant growth decreased significantly. However, while the addition of green light considerably reduced the leaf photosynthetic rate, it did not reduce plant growth. In the absence of blue light, the plants showed symptoms of the shade avoidance response, which possibly enhanced their growth by improving their light interception. Therefore, the addition of 10% (15 mu molaEuro cent m(-2)aEuro cent s(-1)) green light did not have a positive effect on the growth of lettuce. Further study using higher intensities of green light is required to investigate the effects of green light on plant growth.

J	Son, KH; Jeon, YM; Oh, MM				Son, Ki-Ho; Jeon, Yu-Min; Oh, Myung-Min			Application of supplementary white and pulsed light-emitting diodes to lettuce grown in a plant factory with artificial lighting	HORTICULTURE ENVIRONMENT AND BIOTECHNOLOGY			English	Article						bioactive compounds; duty ratio; energy efficiency; frequency; growth	BLUE-LIGHT; LEAF LETTUCE; CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE; QUANTUM YIELD; GREEN LIGHT; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; RED; CULTIVARS; LEAVES; COMBINATIONS	Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are currently undergoing rapid development as plant growth light sources in a plant factory with artificial lighting (PFAL). However, little is known about the effects of supplementary light and pulsed LEDs on plant growth, bioactive compound productions, and energy efficiency in lettuce. In this study, we aimed to determine the effects of supplementary white LEDs (study I) and pulsed LEDs (study II) on red leaf lettuce (Lactuca sativa L. 'Sunmang'). In study I, six LED sources were used to determine the effects of supplementary white LEDs (RGB 7:1:1, 7:1:2, RWB 7:1:2, 7:2:1, 8:1:1, 8:2:0 [based on chip number] on lettuce). Fluorescent lamps were used as the control. In study II, pulsed RWB 7:2:1 LED treatments (30, 10, 1 kHz with a 50 or 75% duty ratio) were applied to lettuce. In study I, the application of red and blue fractions improved plant growth characteristics and the accumulation of antioxidant phenolic compounds, respectively. In addition, the application of green light increased plant growth, including the fresh and dry weights of shoots and roots, as well as leaf area. However, the substitution of green LEDs with white LEDs induced approximately 3.4-times higher light and energy use efficiency. In study II, the growth characteristics and photosynthesis of lettuce were affected by various combinations of duty ratio and frequency. In particular, biomass under a 1 kHz 75% duty ratio of pulsed LEDs was not significantly different from that of the control (continuous LEDs). Moreover, no significant difference in leaf photosynthetic rate was observed between any pulsed LED treatment utilizing a 75% duty ratio versus continuous LEDs. However, some pulsed LED treatments may potentially improve light and energy use efficiency compared to continuous LEDs. These results suggest that the fraction of red, blue, and green wavelengths of LEDs is an important factor for plant growth and the biosynthesis of bioactive compounds in lettuce and that supplementary white LEDs (based on a combination of red and blue LEDs) might be more suitable as a commercial lighting source than green LEDs. In addition, the use of suitable pulses of LEDs might save energy while inducing plant growth similar to that under continuous LEDs. Our findings provide important basic information for designing optimal light sources for use in a PFAL.

To prevent tipburn injury, a sensitive cultivar was tested as an indicator for early symptom detection. An indicator cultivar began to develop tipburn two days earlier than the target cultivar. This allowed for the rescue of the target cultivar by the addition of extra Ca. The yield rate was improved from 4% to 70% with the use of an indicator cultivar in the hydroponic cultures. The top fresh weight of the target cultivar when using an indicator cultivar decreased compared with control plants, but increased compared with negative control plants lacking Ca in the culture. Water contents and root lengths were not affected by the use of an indicator cultivar and additional Ca. These results were consistent with other target cultivars under excess ammonium conditions. This system may be used against tipburn incidence without additional costs and equipment in plant factories. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The objective of this study was to develop a canopy photosynthetic model of romaine lettuce (Lactuca sativa L., cv. Asia Heuk romaine) incorporating CO2 concentration and plant growth stage. The canopy photosynthetic rates of the plants were measured 4, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days after transplanting using closed acrylic chambers, in which the temperature was maintained at 24A degrees C and a 200 A mu mol center dot m (-2) center dot s(-1) light intensity was provided by an 8:1:1 ratio of RBW light-emitting diodes. The canopy photosynthetic rate of the lettuce was calculated by measuring the reduction in CO2 within the chamber over time, from an initial concentration of 2,000 A mu mol center dot mol (-1). The canopy photosynthetic rate became saturated as the CO2 concentration increased, while it exponentially decreased with the plant growth stage. Among the previously published models available, the Thornley model was suitable for the expression of the canopy photosynthetic rate; however, it had to be adapted to take into account growth stage, resulting in an R-2 of 0.985. The canopy photosynthetic rates estimated by the models showed good agreement with those actually measured (R-2 = 0.939). Based on these results, the established model may be helpful in determining the optimum level of CO2 required for crop production and in calculating the decreasing CO2 requirements throughout the cultivation period.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of a newly developed nutrient solution (referred to as NSC) on the growth of this plant and to determine the proper EC level of NSC for stable phytochemical production in plant factories. Three-week-old seedlings were transplanted to a wick culture system supplied with Hoagland solution (EC 1.0 dS center dot m (-1)) as a control or with five different concentrations of NSC (EC 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 dS center dot m (-1)). We grew the plants under normal conditions (20A degrees C, 310 +/- 10 A mu mol center dot m (-2)center dot s (-1) PPF, CO2 1,000 A mu mol center dot mol (-1), and a 16 hours photoperiod) for 6 weeks and evaluated their photosynthetic rates and growth characteristics, such as the fresh and dry weights of shoots and roots, leaf area, number of leaves, and S/R ratios, at 6 weeks after transplanting. We also measured the total phenolic content, antioxidant capacity, and chicoric acid content each week for 6 weeks after transplanting. The fresh weights of shoots and roots, leaf area, and number of leaves significantly increased in plants supplied with 2.0 and 2.5 dS center dot m (-1) NSC compared with the control, while the photosynthetic rate did not change under different concentrations of NSC. The total phenolic content and antioxidant capacity per shoot significantly increased with increasing in EC level of NSC; this trend became more pronounced over time. Moreover, the chicoric acid content significantly increased during growth up to 6 weeks after transplanting. These results suggest that NSC increases the biomass of C. denticulatum and that an EC level of 2.0 or 2.5 dS center dot m (-1) is proper for accumulating high levels of phytochemicals, such as chicoric acid, in C. denticulatum grown in plant factories.

Here, we investigated the effects of light intensity on tipburn development and calcium concentration in leaves by comparing their growth rates. Butterhead lettuce was grown in a plant factory under artificial light at photosynthetic photon flux (PPF) densities of 150, 200, 250, and 300 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1). Fresh and dry weights of shoots, relative growth rate, the number of leaves, and the number of tipburned leaves significantly increased with light intensity. Associations existed between growth and tipburn occurrence. Calcium absorption rate per plant also increased with light intensity in association with increased water absorption rate. Consequently, calcium concentrations in the entire plant and outer leaves increased with light intensity. In contrast, calcium concentration in the inner enclosed leaves did not increase with light intensity. This pattern can be attributed to the higher mass flow of calcium to outer leaves than to inner leaves, driven by transpiration, under high light intensities. Thus, a lack of calcium in the inner leaves resulting from rapid growth may contribute to the frequent tipburn development.

'HS138'), which are long-day plants, to increase the efficiency of fruit production in plant factories. The plants were grown under continuous lighting using three types of blue and red LEDs (blue light peak wavelength: 405, 450, and 470 nm; red light peak wavelength: 630, 660, and 685 nm) during the nursery period. All blue light from the various peak LED types promoted more flowering compared with red light (630 and 660 nm except for 685 nm). The longer wavelength among the red light range positively correlated with earlier flowering, whereas the number of days to anthesis did not significantly differ among blue LED treatment wavelengths, irrespective of peak wavelength. The result of a similar experiment using the perpetual flowering Fragaria vesca accession Hawaii-4 representing a model strawberry species showed almost the same pattern of flowering response to light quality. These results suggest that long-day strawberry plants show similar flowering response to light quality. The photosynthetic rate under red light (660 nm) was higher than that under blue light (450 nm). However, the plants grown under red light showed lower photosynthetic capacity than those grown under blue light. Although the light color used to grow the seedlings showed no difference in the daily fruit production, blue light irradiation during the nursery period hastened harvesting because of the advance in flowering.

'Easy Wave Pink' (a qualitative long-day plant, LDP). Plants were grown in a closed-type plant factory under a constant light intensity of 180 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1) PPF provided by white (W) light emitting diodes (LEDs) under long day (LD, 16 h light/8 h dark), short day (SD, 10 h light/14 h dark), or SD conditions with a 4 h NI using green (NI-G), blue (NI-B), red (NI-R), far-red (NI-Fr), or white (NI-W) LEDs at an intensity of 10 mu mol.m-2.s-1 PPF. Shoot length was greatest under NI-Fr. Flowering was observed under LD, NI-G, NI-Fr, and NI-W. The expression of photoreceptor genes was induced by NI. Specifically, phyA, phyB, and cry1 were more highly expressed under NI-G, NI-B, and NI-R compared to LD and SD. These results suggest that morphogenesis, flowering, and transcriptional factors are strongly affected by light quality during NI.

To test whether this approach presents a viable alternative to horizontal crop production systems, a VFS (where plants were grown in upright cylindrical columns) was compared against a conventional horizontal hydroponic system (HHS) using lettuce (Lactuca sativa L. cv. Little Gem) as a model crop. Both systems had similar root zone volume and planting density. Half-strength Hoagland's solution was applied to plants grown in perlite in an indoor controlled environment room, with metal halide lamps providing artificial lighting. Light distribution (photosynthetic photon flux density, PPFD) and yield (shoot fresh weight) within each system were assessed. Although PPFD and shoot fresh weight decreased significantly in the VFS from top to base, the VFS produced more crop per unit of growing floor area when compared with the HHS. Our results clearly demonstrate that VFS presents an attractive alternative to horizontal hydroponic growth systems and suggest that further increases in yield could be achieved by incorporating artificial lighting in the VFS.

Cultivar, Growing Media, and Nutrient Source Influence Strawberry Yield in a Vertical, Hydroponic, High Tunnel System	HORTTECHNOLOGY			English	Article						controlled-environment agriculture; vertical farming; organic hydroponics; local foods	CUCUMBER PRODUCTION; GROWTH; MANAGEMENT	Demand for local food, including strawberries (Fragaria x ananassa), is increasing throughout the United States. Strawberry production in the midwestern United States can be challenging due to the relatively short growing season and pests. However, vertical, hydroponic, high tunnel production systems could extend the growing season, minimize pest incidence, and maximize strawberry yield and profitability. The objectives of this study were to 1) identify the best cultivars and growing media for vertical, hydroponic, high tunnel production of strawberries in the midwestern United States and to 2) assess potential strategies for replacing synthetic fertilizer with organic nutrient sources in hydroponic strawberry production. To accomplish these objectives, three experiments were conducted across 2 years and two locations in Illinois to compare 11 strawberry cultivars, three soilless media mixtures, and three nutrient sources. Strawberry yield was greatest when grown in perlite mixed with coco coir or vermiculite and fertilized with a synthetic nutrient source. Yield was reduced by up to 15% when fertilized with a bio-based, liquid nutrient source and vermicompost mixed with soilless media. Strawberry yield among cultivars varied by year and location, but Florida Radiance, Monterey, Evie 2, Portola, and Seascape were among the highest-yielding cultivars in at least one site-year. Results contribute to the development of best management practices for vertical, hydroponic, high tunnel strawberry production in the midwestern United States, but further research is needed to understand nutrient dynamics and crop physiological response among levels within vertical, hydroponic towers.

Lettuce is one major cultivated species for both open culture and plant factories and there is little information concerning its circadian clock system. In addition, most of the relevant genes have not been identified. In this study, we detected circadian oscillation in the lettuce transcriptome using time-course RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data. Constant light (LL) and light dark (LD) conditions were used to detect circadian oscillation because the circadian clock has some basic properties: one is self-sustaining oscillation under constant light and another is entrainment to environmental cycles such as light and temperature. In the results, 215 contigs were detected as common oscillating contigs under both LL and LD conditions. The 215 common oscillating contigs included clock gene like contigs CCA1 (CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1)-like, TOC1 (TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION 1) like and LHY (LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL)-like, and their expression patterns were similar to those of Arabiclopsis. Functional enrichment analysis by GO (gene ontology) Slim and GO Fat showed that the GO terms of response to light stimulus, response to stress, photosynthesis and circadian rhythms were enriched in the 215 common oscillating contigs and these terms were actually regulated by circadian clocks in plants. The 215 common oscillating contigs can be used to evaluate whether the gene expression pattern related to photosynthesis and optical response performs normally in lettuce.

Quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Willd.) is a plant native to the Andean region that has become increasing popular as a food source due to its high nutritional content. This study determined the optimal photoperiod, light intensity, and electrical conductivity (EC) of the nutrient solution for growth and yield of quinoa in a closed-type plant factory system. The photoperiod effects were first analyzed in a growth chamber using three different light cycles, 8/16, 14/10, and 16/8 hours (day/night). Further studies, performed in a closed-type plant factory system, evaluated nutrient solutions with EC (salinity) levels of 1.0, 2.0 or 3.0 dS.m(-1). These experiments were assayed with two light intensities (120 and 143 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1)) under a 12/12 and 14/10 hours (day/night) photoperiod. The plants grown under the 16/8 hours photoperiod did not flower, suggesting that a long-day photoperiod delays flowering and that quinoa is a short-day plant. Under a 12/12 h photoperiod, the best shoot yield (both fresh and dry weights) was observed at an EC of 2.0 dS.m(-1) and a photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) of 120 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1). With a 14/10 h photoperiod, the shoot yield (both fresh and dry weights), plant height, leaf area, and light use efficiency were higher when grown with an EC of 2.0 dS.m(-1) and a PPFD of 143 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1). Overall, the optimal conditions for producing quinoa as a leafy vegetable, in a closed-type plant factory system, were a 16/8 h (day/night) photoperiod with an EC of 2.0 dS.m(-1) and a PPFD of 143 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1).

In this study, we developed Planting-density Growth Harvest (PGH) charts to facilitate the estimation of crop growth and harvest factors such as growth rate, relative growth rate, shoot fresh weight, harvesting time, marketable rate, and marketable yield for quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Willd.) and sowthistle (Ixeris dentata Nakai). The plants were grown in a nutrient film technique (NFT) system in a closed-type plant factory under fluorescent lamps with three-band radiation under a light intensity of 140 mu mol center dot m(-2) center dot s(-1), with a 12-h/12-h (day/night) photoperiod. We analyzed the growth and yield of quinoa and sowthistle grown in nutrient solution at EC 2.0 dS center dot m(-1) under four planting densities: 15 cm between rows with a within-row distance of 15 x 10 cm (67 plants/m (2)), 15 x 15 cm (44 plants/m(2)), 15 x 20 cm (33 plants/m(2)), and 15 x 25 cm (27 plants/m(2)). Crop growth rate, relative growth rate, and lost time were closely correlated with planting density. We constructed PGH charts based on the growth data and existing models. Using these charts, growth factors could easily be determined, including growth rate, relative growth rate, and lost time, as well as harvest factors such as shoot fresh weight, marketable yield per area, and harvesting time, based on at least two parameters, for instance, planting density and shoot fresh weight.

Public health and welfare, jobs and wages, labor market concerning employment as long as employability of the work force, inequality, life satisfaction and housing, tourism and environment, economic and energy poverty are heavily impacted by Greece's disadvantageous economic situation. Real estate market could not have gotten away from the financial commotion, being currently in a halt after years of rapid decline. Fired from the present situation of Greece's real estate market, the present study is concerned with the investigation of alternative ways to support the local real estate market. With respect to sustainable development's ethics, the development, implementation, installation and operation of small, inexpensive plant factories within the urban environment is evaluated. Installations such are those, will encourage the penetration of a new market for the untapped buildings' resource, advancing new investing opportunities, promoting economic growth and productivity while creating a new labor market. The study will rely on the basic principles of Life Cycle Costing Assessment and develop a methodology upon which different scenarios will be evaluated against the "Do Nothing" scenario.

The ice plant is a Crassulacean Acid Metabolism (CAM) plant, but performs C-3 photosynthesis during the juvenile period. The objective of this study was to develop a photosynthetic model of ice plants growing under plant factory conditions. C-3 photosynthesis was observed in juvenile plants in plant factory growth conditions and a conversion from C-3 to CAM photosynthesis was observed under salt-stressed condition at an electrical conductivity (EC) of 6.0 dS center dot m(-1). The light saturation and compensation points, determined by a regression analysis of C-3 light curves for the ice plant leaves, were 609.4 and 53.2 mu mol center dot m(-2)center dot s(-1), respectively. The accuracy of the light response was compared between negative exponential and non-rectangular hyperbolic function models. The non-rectangular hyperbola was more accurate with complicated parameters while the negative exponential function was more practical with simple parameters in the light response curves. Measurement of net CO2 assimilation rate (A) and intercellular CO2 concentration (C (i) ) allowed construction of the A-Ci curve and regression analysis of this curve revealed the CO2 saturation and compensation points as 632.9 and 117.2 mu mol center dot mol(-1), respectively. A coupled photosynthetic model was developed for the simultaneous prediction of photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, transpiration, and temperature of the ice plant leaves. Sharkey's regression method was used to determine the photosynthetic parameters of maximum carboxylation rate, the potential rate of electron transport, and the rate of triose phosphate utilization, which were 222.3, 234.9, and 13.0 mu mol center dot m(-2)center dot s(-1), respectively. The parameters of minimum stomatal conductance of water vapor at the light compensation point (b) and the empirical coefficient (m) for the sensitivity of stomatal conductance and relative humidity in the Ball, Woodrow and Berry model could be solved as b = 0.0487 and m = 0.0012 by linear regression analysis using the measured A-Ci values. Although the A-Ci curve of the negative exponential function had higher accuracy than the biochemical model, the coupled biochemical model could physiologically explain the photosynthesis of the ice plant leaves under plant factory conditions.

In a greenhouse crop with high planting density, low photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) at the lower leaves tends to limit plant growth, especially in the winter when the solar altitude and PPFD at the canopy are low and day length is shorter than in summer. Therefore, providing supplemental lighting to the lower canopy can increase year-round productivity. However, supplemental lighting can be expensive. In some places, the cost of electricity is lower at night, but the effect of using supplemental light at night has not yet been examined. In this study, we examined the effects of supplemental LED inter-lighting (LED inter-lighting hereafter) during the daytime or nighttime on photosynthesis, growth, and yield of single-truss tomato plants both in winter and summer. We used LED inter-lighting modules with combined red and blue light to illuminate lower leaves right after the first anthesis. The PPFD of this light was 165 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) measured at 10 cm from the LED module. LED inter lighting was provided from 4:00 am to 4:00 pm for the daytime treatments and from 10:00 pm to 10:00 am for the nighttime treatments. Plants exposed only to solar light were used as controls. Daytime LED inter-lighting increased the photosynthetic capacity of middle and lower canopy leaves, which significantly increased yield by 27% in winter; however, photosynthetic capacity and yield were not significantly increased during summer. Nighttime LED inter-lighting increased photosynthetic capacity in both winter and summer, and yield increased by 24% in winter and 12% in summer. In addition, nighttime LED inter-lighting in winter significantly increased the total soluble solids and ascorbic acid content of the tomato fruits, by 20 and 25%, respectively. Use of nighttime LED inter-lighting was also more cost-effective than daytime inter-lighting. Thus, nighttime LED inter-lighting can effectively improve tomato plant growth and yield with lower energy cost compared with daytime both in summer.

CULTIVARS; GROWTH; EQUATION; BASE	The common ice plant (Mesembryanthemum crystallinum L.) has some medicinal uses and recommended plant in closed-type plant factory. The objective of this study was to estimate the cardinal temperatures for seed germination of the common ice plant using bilinear, parabolic, and beta distribution models. Seeds of the common ice plant were germinated in the dark in a growth chamber at four constant temperatures: 16, 20, 24, and 28 degrees C. For this, four replicates of 100 seeds were placed on two layers of filter paper in a 9-cm petri dish and radicle emergence of 0.1 mm was scored as germination. The times to 50% germination were 4.3, 2.5, 2.0, and 1.8 days at 16, 20, 24, and 28 degrees C, respectively, indicating that the germination of this warm weather crop increased with temperature. Next, the time course of germination was modeled using a logistic function. For the selection of an accurate model, seeds were germinated in the dark at constant temperatures of 6, 12, 32, and 36 degrees C. Germination started earlier and increased rapidly at temperatures above 20 degrees C. The minimum, optimal, and maximum temperatures were estimated by regression of the inverse of time to 50% germination rate, as a function of the temperature gradient. The different functions estimated differing minimum, optimal and maximum temperatures, with 5.7, 27.7, and 36.5 degrees C, respectively for the bilinear function, 13.4, 25.0, and 36.6 degrees C, respectively, for the parabolic function and 7.8, 25.9, and 36.0 degrees C, respectively, for the beta distribution function. The models estimated that the inverse of time to 50% germination rate was 0 at 6 and 36 degrees C. The observed final germination rates at 12 and 32 degrees C were 62 and 97%, respectively. Our data show that a beta distribution function provides a useful model for estimating the cardinal temperatures for germination of seed from the common ice plant.

Thus, identifying and culling the low-grade plants at an early stage, using so-called seedlings diagnosis technology, plays an important role in avoiding large losses in plant factories. In this study, we developed a high-throughput diagnosis system using the measurement of chlorophyll fluorescence (CF) in a commercial large-scale plant factory, which produces about 5000 lettuce plants every day. At an early stage (6 days after sowing), a CF image of 7200 seedlings was captured every 4 h on the final greening day by a high-sensitivity CCD camera and an automatic transferring machine, and biological indices were extracted. Using machine learning, plant growth can be predicted with a high degree of accuracy based on biological indices including leaf size, amount of CF, and circadian rhythms in CF. Growth prediction was improved by addition of temporal information on CF The present data also provide new insights into the relationships between growth and temporal information regulated by the inherent biological clock.

Their periodicity is generated by environmental fluctuations as external factors and the circadian clock as the internal factor. The circadian clock orchestrates physiological events such as photosynthesis or flowering and it enables enhanced growth and herbivory resistance. These characteristics have possible applications for agriculture. In this study, we demonstrated the diurnal variation of the transcriptome in tomato (Solanum lycopersicurn) leaves through molecular timetable method in a sunlight-type plant factory. Molecular timetable methods have been developed to detect periodic genes and estimate individual internal body time from these expression profiles in mammals. We sampled tomato leaves every 2 h for 2 days and acquired time-course transcriptome data by RNA-Seq. Many genes were expressed periodically and these expressions were stable across the 1st and 2nd days of measurement. We selected 143 time-indicating genes whose expression indicated periodically, and estimated internal time in the plant from these expression profiles. The estimated internal time was generally the same as the external environment time; however, there was a difference of more than 1 h between the two for some sampling points. Furthermore, the stress-responsive genes also showed weakly periodic expression, implying that they were usually expressed periodically, regulated by light dark cycles as an external factor or the circadian clock as the internal factor, and could be particularly expressed when the plant experiences some specific stress under agricultural situations. This study suggests that circadian clock mediate the optimization for fluctuating environments in the field and it has possibilities to enhance resistibility to stress and floral induction by controlling circadian clock through light supplement and temperature control.

The objective of this study was to develop a coupled photosynthetic model of sweet basil (Ocimum basilicum L.) reflecting plant factory conditions. Light response curves were generated using photosynthetic models such as negative exponential, rectangular hyperbola, and non-rectangular hyperbola functions. The light saturation and compensation points determined by regression analysis of light curves using modified non-rectangular hyperbola function in sweet basil leaves were 545.3 and 26.5 A mu mol center dot m(-2)center dot s(-1), respectively. The non-rectangular hyperbola was the most accurate with complicated parameters, whereas the negative exponential was more accurate than the rectangular hyperbola and could more easily acquire the parameters of the light response curves of sweet basil compared to the non-rectangular hyperbola. The CO2 saturation and compensation points determined by regression analysis of the A-C-i curve were 728.8 and 85.1 A mu mol center dot mol(-1), respectively. A coupled biochemical model of photosynthesis was adopted to simultaneously predict the photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, transpiration, and temperature of sweet basil leaves. The photosynthetic parameters, maximum carboxylation rate, potential rate of electron transport, and rate of triose phosphate utilization determined by Sharkey's regression method were 102.6, 117.7, and 7.4 A mu mol center dot m(-2)center dot s(-1), respectively. Although the A-C-i regression curve of the negative exponential had higher accuracy than the biochemical model, the coupled biochemical model enable to physiologically explain the photosynthesis of sweet basil leaves.

Although PFALs can produce high-yielding and high-quality plants, the high plant density in these systems accelerates leaf senescence in the bottom (or outer) leaves owing to shading by the upper (or inner) leaves and by neighboring plants. This decreases yield and increases labor costs for trimming. Thus, the establishment of cultivation methods to retard senescence of outer leaves is an important research goal to improve PFAL yield and profitability. In the present study, we developed an LED lighting apparatus that would optimize light conditions for PFAL cultivation of a leafy vegetable. Lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) was hydroponically grown under white, red, or blue LEDs, with light provided from above (downward), with or without supplemental upward lighting from underneath the plant. White LEDs proved more appropriate for lettuce growth than red or blue LEDs, and the supplemental lighting retarded the senescence of outer leaves and decreased waste (i.e., dead or low-quality senescent leaves), leading to an improvement of the marketable leaf fresh weight.

Moreover, harvest qualities depend largely on environmental stresses that elicit plant hormone responses. However, the complexities of plant hormone networks have not been characterized under nonstress conditions. In the present study, we determined temporal expression profiles of all genes and then focused on plant hormone pathways using RNA-Seq analyses of gene expression in tomato leaves every 2 h for 48 h. In these experiments, temporally expressed genes were found in the hormone synthesis pathways for salicylic acid, abscisic acid, ethylene, and jasmonic acid. The timing of CAB expression 1 (TOC1) and abscisic acid insensitive 1 (ABA1) and open stomata 1 (OST1) control gating stomata. In this study, compare with tomato and Arabidopsis thaliana, expression patterns of TOC1 have similarity. In contrast, expression patterns of tomato ABI1 and OST1 had expression peak at different time. These findings suggest that the regulation of gating stomata does not depend predominantly on TOC1 and significantly reflects the extracellular environment. The present data provide new insights into relationships between temporally expressed plant hormone-related genes and clock genes under normal sunlight conditions.

We investigated the effect of atmospheric anion concentrations on plant growth and mineral concentration in kale (Brassica oleracea var. acephala cv. TBC) plants cultivated in a plant factory. Kale seedlings grown under normal growth conditions for two weeks were transplanted to a nutrient film technique (NFT) system in a plant factory equipped with light-emitting diodes (LEDs) [red:white:blue (RWB) = 8:1:1 and red:green:blue (RGB) = 8:1:1, 181 +/- 4.0 A mu mol center dot m(-2)center dot s(-1), 12 h photoperiod]. Three concentrations of air anions (low, 2.9 x 10(5) ions center dot cm(-3); medium, 5.4 x 10(5) ions center dot cm(-3); and high, 7.8 x 10(5) ions center dot cm(-3)) were applied to the kale seedlings for four weeks using high voltage air anion generators. The medium and high levels of air anions increased shoot fresh weight to approximately 1.5-fold compared to the control after four weeks. Medium and high-level air anion treatments led to significantly higher leaf area than the control. The medium level of air anions improved the photosynthetic rate at four weeks of treatment although there was no significant difference between air anion treatments and the control. In addition, transpiration rate and stomatal conductance were significantly increased in the low and medium levels of air anion treatments, which likely supported biomass accumulation. Air anions also increased mineral uptake. The content of macroelements (P, K, Ca, Mg, and S) was at least 1.5-fold higher for plants exposed to RGB LEDs and 1.3-fold higher under RWB LEDs exposure. Microelements (Fe, Mn, and Zn) were increased at least 1.6- and 1.3-fold in kale shoots treated with air anions under RGB and RWB LEDs, respectively. In conclusion, air anions had a positive effect on kale growth and air anion generators could be used as a new technology for enhancing plant growth in plant factories and greenhouses.

This work, including two indoor box experiments, was conducted in 2013 and 2014 at Nanjing University, Jiangsu Province, China. The plant characteristics include survival rate, number of buds, number of branches, maximum length of new shoot, number of new leaves, biomass, OD (Optical Density) value of soluble sugar and soluble protein, and concentration of chlorophyll. These characteristics were quantified with seedling age (1-year to 4-year-old seedlings), cutting position (apex, middle, base of the seedling stem) and cultivation methods (hydroponics and cuttage) in the age experiment, and cutting season (spring, summer, autumn, winter), cutting position (apex, middle, base of the seedling stem) and cultivation methods (hydroponics and cuttage) in the season experiment. Results showed that cuttings derived from 1-year-old seedling stems displayed better morphological and physiological characteristics than from other seedling ages. Cuttings of newly obtained from 1-year-old fresh seedling stems and derived from four seasons were all sprouted well in two cultivation methods (hydroponics and cuttage). Cuttings derived from apical and middle positions in spring and basal positions in autumn displayed better performance than the other treatments. Cuttings cultivated by cuttage exhibited better physiological characteristics than by hydroponics. We concluded that the cuttings of Chinese toon could be cultivated all year round for vegetable production. To obtain faster and more even stands of Chinese toon sprouts in plant factory, we recommended the use of cuttings from 1-year-old Chinese toon seedling stems, apical and middle parts from spring and basal positions from autumn, and use of cuttage method.

Cultivation was conducted in two separate locations, namely, a growth chamber (GC) illuminated with LED lights as the sole light source and a plastic greenhouse (PG) which was given supplemental LED light in addition to ambient light. It was noted that leaves of plants cultivated in the GC under LED lights displayed elevated levels of chlorophyll compared with those cultivated in the PG. In contrast, plants cultivated in the PG with supplementary LED lights yielded much higher production of fruits than those cultivated in the GC. Moreover, fruits harvested in the PG were demonstrated to contain higher levels of organic acids than those harvested in the GC. When the effects of different LED lights were examined, a remarkably higher production of fruits was achieved in the PG when ambient light was supplemented with either blue LED light or combined blue and red LED light. Furthermore, it was also noted that greater accumulation of organic acids and phytochemicals such as phenolic compounds were observed in the fruits that had been cultivated in the PG when ambient light was supplemented with either red LED light or combined blue and red LED lights.

The objective of this study was to investigate the influences of different environmental conditions (BLSS, plant factory, green house and field) on the wheat growth, thousand kernel weight (TKW), harvest index (HI), biomass yield and quality during their life cycle. The results showed that plant height partially influenced by the interaction effects with environment, and this influence decreased gradually with the plant development. It was found that there was no significant difference between the BLSS and plant factory treatments on yields per square, but the yield of green house and field treatments were both lower. TKW and HI in BLSS and plant factory were larger than those in the green house and field. However, grain protein concentration can be inversely correlated with grain yield. Grain protein concentrations decreased under elevate CO2 condition and the magnitude of the reductions depended on the prevailing environmental condition. Conditional interaction effects with environment also influenced the components of straw during the mature stage. It indicated that CO2 enriched environment to some extent was better for inedible biomass degradation and had a significant effect on "source-sink flow" at grain filling stage, which was more beneficial to recycle substances in the processes of the environment regeneration.

Sixteen-day-old lettuce seedlings were transferred into growth chambers and cultivated under various ratios of red (R) and far-red (FR) LEDs (R/FR = 0.7, 1.2, 4.1, and 8.6), only red LEDs (RED), or fluorescent lamps (control) for 22 days. Growth characteristics were measured at 11 and 22 days of treatment. In addition, cell division rate, epidermal cell density, chlorophyll fluorescence, and photosynthesis of leaves were analyzed. Fresh and dry weights and leaf area in all R/FR treatments were higher than those in the control at 22 days of treatment. The R/FR 1.2 had the highest values among R/FR treatments. The number of leaves appeared to increase as R/FR ratio increased. The specific leaf weights in the R/FR ratio of 0.7, 1.2, and 8.6 were similar to the control at 22 days of treatment. The SPAD values in all R/FR treatments were lower than that in the control. All R/FR treatments led to a longer leaf shape than the control. The percentage of cells in the G2M phase, indicating the cell division rate, increased in the R/FR treatments after 4 days of treatment, which supported the growth improvement in the R/FR treatments. The Fv/Fm and the photosynthetic rate in all treatments decreased due to the absence of blue light. The results of this study suggest that the supplementation with far-red LEDs should be considered when designing artificial lighting systems for closed-type plant factories since far-red light affects the vegetative growth of leafy vegetables such as lettuce.

Elevation of atmospheric CO2 concentration is a good candidate; however, it is technically difficult to evaluate the effect on fruit growth by comparing different individuals in different CO2 conditions because of large inter-individual variations. In this study, we employed a positron-emitting tracer imaging system (PETIS), which is a live-imaging technology for plant studies, and a short-lived radioisotope C-11 to quantitatively analyze immediate responses of carbon fixation and translocation in tomatoes in elevated CO2 conditions. We also developed a closed cultivation system to feed a test plant with CO2 at concentrations of 400, 1,500 and 3,000 ppm and a pulse of (CO2)-C-11. As a result, we obtained serial images of C-11 fixation by leaves and subsequent translocation into fruits. Carbon fixation was enhanced steadily by increasing the CO2 concentration, but the amount translocated into fruits saturated at 1,500 ppm on average. The translocation rate had larger inter-individual variation and showed less consistent responses to external CO2 conditions compared with carbon fixation. Our experimental system was demonstrated to be a valuable tool for the optimization of closed cultivation systems because it can trace the responses of carbon translocation in each individual, which are otherwise usually masked by inter-individual variation.

The illumination schedules used were fixed LED [F-LED (four LED panels illuminated the area below)] and movable LED [M-LED (two LED panels moved left and right once per day to illuminate the same area as F-LED)] at distances of 10 and 30 cm above the seedlings. The plant yields were uniform in all LED treatments. The highest light utilization efficiencies and lowest electricity consumption were found for the treatments with irradiation from a shorter distance above the seedlings. The true leaf numbers and ascorbic acid concentrations were the highest in the M-LED and F-LED treatments at a distance above the seedlings of 10 cm, while the leaf lengths and sucrose concentrations in these groups were significantly lower than those in the 30-cm treatment. These results indicate that illumination with M-LED can halve the initial light source input while maintaining yield and that sustained illumination from a shorter distance above the seedlings is the main factor in electricity savings.

To solve these problems, plant factories have been attracting attention recently. Plant factories are facilities that aid the steady production of high-quality vegetables year round by artificially controlling the cultivation environment, allowing growers to drastically decrease production time. Despite the many advantages of plant factories, a main impediment is the reduction of initial and running costs. This paper utilizes leaf lettuce (Early impulse), which is a typical item cultivated in plant factories, as a target to improve productive efficiency of plant factories due to its relatively high price. Various pulsed electric fields (PEFs) were applied to roots of the lettuce to increase lettuce growth rate. The experimental results show PEF intensity from 0.2 to 1.0 kV/cm is positive for growth stimulation. Conversely, those over 1.0 kV/cm resulted in growth inhibition. Furthermore, roots of the samples which exhibited increased leaf weight grew more robustly than those of decreased leaf weight. In addition, analysis results showed that there was no significant difference when liquid fertilizer was applied prior to or after application of PEF. The results suggest that PEF does not affect the composition change of liquid fertilizer but directly influences the growth of leaf lettuce.

Red leaf lettuce (Lactuca sativa L. cv. 'Jeokchima') seedlings grown under normal growth conditions (20A degrees C, fluorescent lamp, 150 +/- 3 mu mol center dot m(-2)center dot s(-1) PPFD, 12-h photoperiod) for 18 days were transplanted to hydroponic systems in a plant factory equipped with LEDs (red:blue = 78:22, 184 +/- 2 mu mol center dot m(-2)center dot s(-1) PPFD, 12-h photoperiod). Three levels of air anions (low, 10 x 10(4) ion center dot cm(-3); medium, 19 x 104 ion center dot cm(-3); and high, 70 x 10(4) ion center dot cm(-3)) were applied to lettuce plants for 4 weeks. Lettuce plants exposed to air anions showed vigorous growth after 2 and 4 weeks of treatment. Both the medium and high levels of air anions improved growth characteristics such as leaf area and fresh weight of shoots, but there were no significant differences in the number of leaves and SPAD values were observed between the treatments. The medium level of air anions resulted in a 64% increase in shoot fresh weight compared to the control at 4 weeks after treatment. The photosynthetic rate of lettuce grown in the medium level of air anions after 3 weeks of treatment was 30% higher than that of the control. In addition, energy use efficiency in air anion treatments was higher than that in the control. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that the application of air anions in a plant factory imparts a positive effect on lettuce growth with low production cost.

Previous studies have demonstrated that ultraviolet (UV) light is effective in improving phytochemical production. This study aimed to determine the effect of various UV wavelengths on growth and phenolic compound accumulation in lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) grown in a closed-type plant production system. RESULTSSeven days, 1 day and 0.25 day were determined as the upper limit of the irradiation periods for UV-A, -B, and -C, respectively, in the lettuce based on physiological disorders and the fluorescence parameter F-v/F-m. Continuous UV-A treatment significantly induced the accumulation of phenolic compounds and antioxidants until 4 days of treatment without growth inhibition, consistent with an increase in phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) gene expression and PAL activity. Repeated or gradual UV-B exposure yielded approximately 1.4-3.6 times more total phenolics and antioxidants, respectively, than the controls did 2 days after the treatments, although both treatments inhibited lettuce growth. Repeated UV-C exposure increased phenolics but severely inhibited the growth of lettuce plants. CONCLUSIONOur data suggest that UV irradiation can improve the accumulation of phenolic compounds with antioxidant properties in lettuce cultivated in plant factories.
