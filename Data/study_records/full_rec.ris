AB  - Although ultraviolet-B (UV-B, 280-315 nm) radiation has been known as an effective elicitor for improving bioactive compound contents in plants, its practical application to plant factories is still in its infancy. This study aimed to develop an evaluation method for optimising the lighting design of UV-B radiation in plant factories. To this end, a prediction model of phenolic content was adapted for kale (Brassica oleracea L. var. acephala) plants grown in a plant factory using an optical simulation in a three-dimensional plant model. The prediction model was calibrated using experimental data with different 310 nm UV-B light-emitting diode (LED) arrangements. UV-B radiation significantly enhanced the total phenolic content, total flavonoid content, UV-B absorbing pigment content, and antioxidant capacity in kale plants. In scenario analysis with variables of lighting system, such as vertical or horizontal lighting distance and lighting angle of UV-B LED, the spatial distribution of phenolic accumulation was estimated using the calibrated model and simulated UV-B radiation interception. Although the uniformity and efficiency were opposite in most scenarios, both values for phenolic production increased with changes in horizontal position. The annual yields per electrical energy consumed for producing total phenolics and flavonoids were expected to improve by 14.2 and 34.0%, respectively, assuming the addition of UV-B LED as the optimal lighting design among the scenarios. These evaluation and optimisation methods using model-based simulations will help to design custom UV-B lighting systems for the production of bioactive compounds in commercial plant factories.

AB  - Sunlight contains a wide range of the spectrum, and the spectrum used for plant photosynthesis is mainly located in the visible band (380-780 nm), while the spectral energy of other bands is not suitable for plant growth because it generates heat in summer. In this paper, a novel spectral-splitting solar indoor lighting system with a reflective direct-absorption cavity for Plant Factory was developed, which used the combination of pure water and spectrum splitting mirrors to perfectly separate the visible light and non-visible light of sunlight. Visible light was conducted to Plant Factory by optical fiber to provide illumination for plants, and non-visible light was trapped and then absorbed by a reflective direct-absorption cavity and convert into thermal energy. The structural parameters of the reflective direct-absorption cavity were optimized based on the Monte Carlo method, and the light conduction and heat transfer models were established to analyze the photo-thermal performance of the device. The results of indoor and outdoor tests showed that the solar energy utilization efficiency of the device could reach 50%, among which the light transmission efficiency and heat collection efficiency were 24.7% and 25.3%, respectively. The temperature of the optical fiber coupling end face was kept in the range of 27-37 degrees C, which can ensure the safe and efficient operation of the optical fiber. It provides a new idea for the protection of optical fiber, the efficiency improvement of sunlight conduction lighting technologies, and the energy saving of the Plant Factory lighting in the future.

The developed facility that shall be utilised is introducing, in practice, a sustainable Energy-Food nexus plan that can be implemented and put into action by the independent power producers and municipalities, meeting also the goal of supporting the grid (a Food to Grid approach). A case study was tested, and it was found that a scheme that couples the curtailed power with a potential mass deployment of vertical farms is beyond sustainable and even with very low marginal price-earnings and the minimum price offered for vertical farms, under specific scenarios can have a full payback in 14 years as an investment. However, in the average optimal case, the investors can get their investments back in 7 years, with an internal rate of return of 17%.

AB  - Uncertain climate changes and increasing energy and food production demands lead to food insecurity, especially for drought-prone areas like the study region, Iran. This study assesses the energy use, economic, and environmental impacts of two different healing and acclimatization systems, the conventional tunnel systems (CTS) and the LED-equipped vertical systems (LVS), for grafted watermelon seedlings in Iran. Life cycle assessment (LCA), cumulative exergy demand (CExD), and life cycle cost analysis (LCCA) approaches are used to assess the impacts of grafted watermelon seedlings. The functional unit is one million grafted watermelon seedlings (MGWS). The top findings of this study indicate that CTS increases energy consumption, damage to human health, ecosystems, and resources compared with the LVS. Further, the economic analysis revealed that the net profit in the multi-floored LVS is 24% higher than that of the CTS. In conclusion, LVS is less energy consumptive and environmentally burdensome yet more profitable than the CTS. Notably, the finding from this study supports recommendations that will be useful for industries or producers who need to develop sustainable grafted watermelon or vegetable production systems in Iran or similar regions. Top recommendations include using organic fertilizers, multi-floor LVS, and most importantly, replacing CTS with LVS to promote a sustainable agricultural production system.

AB  - Can skyscrapers survive after COVID-19? Can the idea of integrating vertical farming (VF) into vertical architecture support the environmental, economic, and social issues in the post-pandemic era? Answering these questions is the main objective of this study. Therefore, it explores a) the impact of the pandemic on the built environment, especially skyscrapers; b) the challenges facing the survival of skyscrapers; c) the design parameters and main components of VF; and d) the expected feasibility of integrating VF into vertical architecture to reduce the effects of the pandemic. The research concludes that the skyscraper-integrated vertical farming (SIVF) paradigm can create a closed ecosystem that preserves the environment by a) supporting food security, b) improving indoor environmental quality, c) enhancing psychological and physical health, d) saving energy, e) reducing greenhouse gas emissions and releasing oxygen, and f) supporting the local economy. Consequently, the SIVF paradigm can inaugurate an innovative approach that provides insights into new research trends and discoveries. However, further constraints in the adoption of SIVF should be addressed, and collaborations between researchers and multidisciplinary experts must be created to achieve suitable solutions.

AB  - Agricultural practice in adjusting planting density and harvest date are important factors for plant development and crop improvement, reaching maximum yields and enhancing the production of secondary metabolites. However, it is unclear as to the optimal planting densities during mass production that encourage consistent, high yield secondary metabolite content. For this, controlled environment, crop production facilities such as plant factories with artificial lighting (PFAL) offer opportunity to enhance quality and stabilize production of herbal plants. This study assessed the effect of plant density and harvest date on physiological responses, yield and andrographolide (AP1) content in Andrographis paniculata (Andrographis) using hydroponic conditions in a PFAL system. Andrographis, harvested at vegetative stage (30 days after transplanting; 30 DAT) and initial stage of flowering (60 DAT) exhibited no significant differences in growth parameters or andrographolide accumulation according to planting densities. Harvest time at flowering stage (90 DAT) showed the highest photosynthetic rates at a planting density of 15 plants m(-2). Highest yield, number of leaves, and Andrographolide (AP1) content (mg per gram of DW in m(2)) were achieved at a more moderate planting density (30 plants m(-2)). Finally, five out of seventeen indices of leaf reflectance reveal high correlation (r= 0.8 to 1.0 and r= -0.8 to -1.0, P<0.01) with AP1 content. These results suggest that a planting density of 30 plants m(-2) and harvest time of 90 DAT provide optimal growing condition under the hydroponic PFAL system.

AB  - Indoor saffron farming systems under controlled conditions are required to meet the high demand for this valuable crop. The aim of the present study was to determine the flowering, growth, and yield responses of saffron grown using nutrient solutions with different electrical conductivity (EC) levels (0.7, 1.4, and 2.1 dS m(-1)). Sprouted saffron corms were cultured for 24 weeks under a volcanic rock-based aerated continuous immersion system. Vegetative growth and leaf gas exchange, but not flowering, were affected significantly by EC levels. The optimal EC in a balanced nutrient solution was 0.7 dS m(-1), at which level the highest plant height, leaf area, biomass, photosynthetic rate, number of daughter corms, and percentage of corms >= 25 mm were recorded. An EC level of 2.1 dS m(-1) decreased the photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, and transpiration rate of saffron but increased biochemical stress marker levels and elevated various antioxidant defense enzyme levels significantly in saffron leaves, possibly reflecting a defense response to the cellular damage provoked by the higher EC level. In terms of nutrient solution EC, 0.7 dS m(-1) was optimal in saffron, whereas 2.1 dS m(-1) caused oxidative stress that led to reduced growth and daughter corm production.

AB  - The effects of light intensity and photoperiod, and their combination as daily light integrals (DLI) on the growth and physiological traits of Panax ginseng seedlings were investigated to establish a light environment for seedling production. Stratified seeds of Panax ginseng 'Chunpoong' were sown. The seedlings were cultivated for 20 weeks using warm-white LEDs with DLI from 1.44 to 10.94 mol m(-2) d(-1), which are combinations of three light intensities (50, 120, and 190 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) and three photoperiods (8, 12, and 16 h d(-1)) in a plant factory with artificial lighting (PFAL). As the DLI increased, the shoot length and leaf area were exponentially reduced after shoot development at both nine and 20 weeks of treatments. At nine weeks of treatment, the greater light intensity and longer photoperiod treatments, where the shoot established fastest, the photosynthetic products were translocated to the roots first and the dry weight distribution in the root increased as DLI increased. In the high light intensity and long photoperiod treatments, SPAD value, maximum (F-v/F-m), and minimum (F-v/F-o) quantum efficiency tended to decrease, and the photosynthetic traits were negatively affected over time with leaf senescence. The root growth rate in high light intensity with long photoperiod treatments seemed to lag behind that in low light intensity with short photoperiod treatments. As a result, this study found that a light intensity of 50 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) with a 12 h d(-1) photoperiod (DLI of 2.16 mol m(-2) d(-1)) was a suitable light environment for both shoot and root growth of ginseng seedlings. Further, the shoot establishment should be considered to design a light environment for ginseng seedling production in a PFAL.

AB  - The ice plant (Mesembryanthemum crystallinum L.) has become a halophyte model to study the plant photosynthetic responses C-3 photosynthesis to crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM), which is accelerated by salt stress. However, this adaptive mechanism improves water use efficiency, and water stress tolerance is still poorly known. This study examined the effect of individual and mixture of NaCl and CaCl2 concentrations on morphological parameters and bioactive component contents of ice plants in a plant factory system. Eight salt treatments individually and a combination of sodium chloride (NaCl) and calcium chloride (CaCl2), and Hoagland solutions were applied after the transplanting of ice plants. Morphological parameters like the number of leaves and lateral stems, leaf chlorophyll content (SPAD value), fresh weight, and dry weight of shoots and roots were measured at the adult stage. Concurrently, in the juvenile phase, the area of a canopy was evaluated using an image processing technique in HSV (hue, saturation, value) colour space. Correspondingly, ice plant secondary metabolites such as cations, anions, and radical scavenging activity were assayed in the adult phase correlated to the salt stress. The effects of salt stress on the growth of ice plants and secondary metabolite production were analysed using completely randomized block designs through the variance by one-way ANOVA with a significance level of p < 0.05. This study demonstrated that 400 mM CaCl2 (T-4) enhanced the biomass and high sodium (Na+) and calcium (Ca2+) accumulations, and 200 mM CaCl2 (T-3) accelerated the potassium (K+), magnesium (Mg2+), phosphate (PO43-), and sulfate (SO42-) accumulations. Moreover, NaCl 400 mM (T-1) and combination of 100 mM NaCl and 300 mM CaCl2 (T-5) positively influenced the chloride (Cl-) deposition and combination of 200 mM NaCl and 200 mM CaCl2 (T-6) improved nitrate (NO3-) accretion.

AB  - Indoor Vertical Farms (IVF) can contribute to urban circular food systems by reducing food waste and increasing resource use efficiency. They are also known for high energy consumption but could potentially be improved by integration with buildings. Here, we aim to quantify the environmental performance of a prospective building-integrated urban farm. We performed a Life Cycle Assessment for a unit installed in a university campus in Portugal, producing broccoli microgreens for salads. This technology integrates IVF, product processing and Internet of Things with unused space. Its environmental performance was analyzed using two supply scenarios and a renewable energy variation was applied to each scenario. Results show that the IVF system produces 7.5 kg of microgreens daily with a global warming potential of 18.6 kg CO(2)e/kg in the case of supply direct on campus, or 22.2 kg CO(2)e/kg in the case of supply off campus to retailers within a 10-km radius. Consistently in both scenarios, electricity contributed the highest emission, with 10.03 kg CO(2)e/kg, followed by seeds, with 4.04 kg CO(2)e/kg. The additional use of photovoltaic electricity yields a reduction of emissions by 32%; an improvement of approximately 16% was found for most environmental categories. A shortened supply chain, coupled with renewable electricity production, can contribute significantly to the environmental performance of building-integrated IVF.

AB  - The literature on agricultural technology (ag-tech) for urban agriculture (UA) offers many narratives about its benefits in addressing the challenges of sustainability and food security for urban environments. In this paper, we present a literature review for the period 2015-2022 of research carried out on currently active UA installations. We aim to systematise the most common narratives regarding the benefits of controlled environment agriculture (CEA) and soil-less growing systems in urban buildings and assess the existence of peer-reviewed data supporting these claims. The review was based on 28 articles that provided detailed information about 68 active UA installations depicting multiple types of ag-tech and regions. The results show that most research conducted for commercial UA-CEA installations was carried out in North America. Standalone CEA greenhouses or plant factories as commercial producers for urban areas were mostly found in Asia and Europe. The most often cited benefits are that the integration of multiple CEA technologies with energy systems or building climate systems enables the transfer of heat through thermal airflow exchange and CO2 fertilisation to improve commercial production. However, this review shows that the data quantifying the benefits are limited and, therefore, the exact environmental effects of CEA are undetermined.

AB  - Stevia rebaudiana cultivated in non-native tropical conditions tends to flower early, halting vegetative growth, resulting in lower biomass and yields of its valued steviol glycoside metabolites. While indoor cultivation allows manipulation of artificial lighting to mimic optimal conditions, it introduces an additional energy cost. The study objectives were to assess photoperiod manipulation as a lighting strategy to increase overall biomass and metabolite yields as well as to improve the efficacy of the electrical energy used for indoor cultivation of Stevia rebaudiana in non-native environmental conditions. Stevia was grown under artificial lighting with red, green, and blue wavelengths with photoperiods of 8 h, 12 h, 16 h, and intermittent light amounting to 16/24 h, each with a constant Daily Light Integral (DLI) of 7.2 mol M-2 day(-1). Yield was measured as leaf dry weight biomass in combination with Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LCMS) analysis of Stevioside and Rebaudioside A content. The photon flux density of the artificial and natural light as measured by a spectroradiometer, and the energy use data collected with a three-phase power quality logger, were compared for each treatment tested and to that from plants grown under natural light irradiation in a greenhouse. Yield and energy data were used to determine the efficacies of the lighting systems tested. Stevia plants under a continuous 16-h photoperiod (16H) had the highest productivity, resulting in the highest biomass accumulation and metabolite concentrations. The Stevioside and Rebaudioside A yields per plant were 975% higher than those obtained under natural daylight and day-neutral tropical photoperiod. Overall energy use and photon conversion efficacies were also highest under 16H at 65.10 g kWh(-1) for biomass accumulation, 12.40 g kWh(-1) for metabolite yields and 7.5 mg mol(-1) for photon conversion. These findings support the application of photoperiod manipulation as a viable approach to increase productivity and improve energy use efficacies for indoor cultivation of Stevia rebaudiana plants under artificial lighting in non-native environments with the 16-h photoperiod under red and blue artificial light supplemented with green spectrum as the best option.

AB  - Vertical farming is a new branch of urban agriculture using indoor vertical space and soil-less cultivation technology to obtain agricultural products. Despite its many advantages over traditional farming, it still faces some challenges and obstacles, including high energy consumption and costs, as well as uncertainty and a lack of social acceptance. This study aims to investigate the influence of public acceptance on micro-vertical farming based on the deconstructed theory of planned behavior model. This model is adopted for statistical analysis to reveal the factors and their weights in influencing people's behavioral intentions. The results indicate that the overall mean of the public's behavioral intentions to use vertical farming is 3.9, which is above neutral (M = 3.00) but less than positive (M = 4.00). Differences in age, education level, and the living area of the public have significantly impacted behavioral intentions. Meanwhile, the statistical results support the hypotheses concerning the behavioral attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control of the model, and also demonstrate that their decomposed belief structures considerably influence the public's behavioral intentions to use vertical farming. Notably, perceived usefulness is the most critical driving factor in planting using vertical farming. The findings of this study contribute to better predictions of the effects of different elements of behavioral intention on vertical farming at the urban scale, which may provide a basis for decision making in the development of sustainable urban agriculture.

AB  - The United States (U.S.) aims to reduce half of food loss and waste (FLW) by 2030. To achieve this goal, the public, academic, and political attentions on FLW have been increasing, and a series of actions have been implemented. However, the actions lack consideration on the categorical priority of FLW mitigation in relation to environmental footprints. In this article, we compare the FLW of three main plant food categories (i.e., grains, vegetables, and fruits) and their water and carbon footprints during 1970-2017. The vegetable FLW doubled during the period, reaching 3.39 x 1010 kg in 2017, which was 5- and 2-fold higher than the FLW of grains and fruits, respectively. The FLW of vegetables, grains, and fruits contributed 29%, 47%, and 24% to the total blue water wasted through FLW. The total carbon dioxide emissions generated by plant FLW were contributed by vegetables with 50%, grains with 31%, and fruits with 19%. Canonical correspondence analysis indicates that vegetable FLW had a higher positive correlation with urbanization, household incomes, gross domestic product, and high-income population than grain FLW, whereas fruit FLW was not influenced by these socioeconomic factors. Therefore, we suggest that the FLW mitigation should be prioritized on vegetables. Specific strategies include local food sourcing, shortening food miles, building food belts, and developing controlled-environment agriculture. Our data-based comparisons provide valuable insights into food policy improvement for achieving the 2030 reduction goal of the U.S., but the insights could be improved by considering the influences of foods imported from other nations.

AB  - Sensors are vital in controlled environment agriculture for measuring parameters for effective decision-making. Currently, most growers randomly install a limited number of sensors due to economic implications and data management issues. The microclimate within a protected cultivation system is continuously affected by the macroclimate (ambient), which further complicates decision-making around optimal sensor placement. The ambient weather's effect on the indoor microclimate makes it challenging to predict or acquire the ideal condition of the systems through using sensors. This study proposed and implemented a machine learning (KMeans++) algorithm to select optimal sensor locations through clustering. Temperature and relative humidity data were collected from 56 different locations within the greenhouse for over a year covering and these covered four major seasons (spring, summer, autumn, and winter). The data was processed to remove outliers or noise interference using interquartile. The original temperature and relative humidity data were transformed to other air properties (dew point temperature, enthalpy, humid ratio, and specific volume) and used in simulations. The results obtained showed that the number of optimal sensor locations ranged between 3 and 5, and there were similar sensor locations among the air properties. An online machine learning web-based system was developed to systematically determine the optimal number of sensors and location.

AB  - The rapidly growing population and increasing urbanization have created the need to produce more food and transport it safely to urban areas where the majority of global consumers live. Open-field agriculture and food distribution systems have a lot of food waste, and, in parallel, the largest percentage of available arable land is already occupied. In most cases, food produced by compatible agricultural methods needs to be frozen and travel several miles until it reaches the consumer, with high amounts of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions produced by this process, making it an unsustainable method with huge amounts of CO2 emissions related with fresh food products. This research contains an extensive literature review based on 165 international publications (from 2006-2022) describing and analyzing the efficiency and impact of controlled-environment agriculture (CEA) methods, and more precisely, greenhouses (GHs) and vertical farms (VFs), in the environmental footprint of food production and consumption. Based on various publications, we could draw the conclusion that VFs could highly influence a greener transition to the sustainability of urban consumption with reduced CO2 emissions sourcing from food transportation and limited post-harvest processes. However, there is a significant demand for further energy efficiency, specifically when it comes to artificial lighting operations inside VFs. A large-scale implementation of VFs that operate with renewable energy sources (RES) could lead to significant urban decarbonization by providing the opportunity for integrated energy-food nexus systems. Under this direction, VFs could optimize the way that cities interact with meeting the food and energy demand in densely urbanized areas.

AB  - Application of light-emitting diode technology has opened opportunities to optimize light spectrum for crop production greenhouses and vertical farms. In addition to photosynthetically active radiation, far-red (FR) light has shown potential for enhancing leaf photosynthesis. However, additional FR also alters the red to far-red ratio (R:FR) and induces a shade-avoidance response (SAR) that changes leaf nitrogen, thickness and mass. These acclimations can potentially also alter the resistance to CO2 diffusion, which can limit photosynthesis. Tomato plants were grown with and without additional FR at two light levels. Changes in photosynthetic responses to light and CO2 diffusion resistance, as well as leaf mass, thickness and nitrogen content were assessed. At low light additional FR strongly reduced leaf maximum photosynthesis, leaf mass, thickness and nitrogen, and increased the resistance to CO2 diffusion. These effects were to a much lesser extent present in plants grown at high light intensity. Tomato leaves grown under low light intensity supplemented with FR, show much stronger SAR and a larger increase in CO2 diffusion resistance than plants grown under high light, which negatively influences their photosynthesis at increasing light intensity. Only if the negative effects of sensitivity to FR and SAR response can be avoided, supplemental FR light may be beneficial to enhance photosynthesis in greenhouse and vertical farm systems.

AB  - In this study, we investigated the effect of UV-B irradiation 3 days prior to harvest, on the accumulation of rosmarinic acid (RA) and anthocyanin, and the expression of genes related to phenylpropanoid and flavonoid biosynthetic pathways, in red perilla (Perilla frutescens L.). In experiment 1, seedlings at 60 days after sowing (DAS) were subjected to UV-B irradiation at 0 (control), 6, and 10 W m(-2) under a 16 h light period; while in experiment 2, seedlings at 45 DAS were subjected to UV-B irradiation at 0 (control), 4 W m(-2) at continuous irradiation, and 6 W m(-2) at 16 h irradiation. UV irradiation of 10 W m(-2) for 16 h negatively affected leaf color, while irradiation at 6 W m(-2) enhanced RA biosynthesis and antioxidant capacity. Continuous UV-B irradiation of 4 W m(-2) increased the RA concentration by 92% compared to the control; however, this effect was smaller than that of UV-B irradiation at 6 W m(-2) for 16 h, 141% higher than that of the control and had a lower antioxidant capacity against UV-mediated ROS overproduction during the dark period. Results demonstrate that 6 W m(-2) of UV-B irradiation for 16 h is suitable for enhancing the RA concentration and content of red perilla.

AB  - Air movement greatly affects plant growth and therefore providing adequate air movement and uniform growth environment is important. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were applied to study transport phenomena of flow fields inside a commercial, large-scale indoor plant factory, having the goal to improve climate uniformity and subsequently crop uniformity. Five designs of ventilation system were compared with different combinations of air supply vents and return air outlets with steady-state simulation. The climate uniformity was compared with relative standard deviation (RSD) in five cases for air current speed (m s(-1)), air temperature (K), and vapour pressure deficit (Pa) at just above the top surfaces of crop canopies. These included Case 1-with supply air inlets and return air outlets installed on opposite side walls; Case 2 with inlets and outlets placed in alternating rows on the ceiling; Case 3 with the same size and location of inlets as in Case 2 but with outlets placed on two side walls at the floor level; Case 4 with perforated air tubes installed above aisles and outlets placed on the ceiling; and Case 5 with a perforated air tube installed at each level of shelves. With the localized air ventilation method (Case 5), the climate uniformity at the crop canopy was improved compared to the control case (Case 1). The RSD for the averages of air current speed, air temperature, and vapour pressure deficit (VPD) were improved by 14.3%, 0.1%, and 1.0% respectively. (C) 2022 IAgrE. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are expected to be effective light sources for growing wheat in indoor cultivation due to their small size, long lifespan, high safety performance, and customized wavelengths. In the present study, the influences of LEDs light sources with different spectra combinations were investigated in wheat plants grown in hydroponic system. Eight types of different spectra were compared: white light (W), white-green light (W:G = 4:1, W4G1), red-green light (R:G = 4:1, R4G1), red-green-blue light (R:G:B = 4:1:1, R4G1B1), and four types of red-blue lights (R:B = 3:1, R3B1; R:B = 2:1, R2B1; R:B = 1:1, R1B1; R:B = 1:6, R1B6). The growth and development were monitored together with the activity of antioxidant enzymes in leaves. In addition, grain yield and quality were also investigated. The results showed that winter wheat could complete its life cycle under all eight LEDs light regimens in the completely enclosed hydroponic cultivation environment. Among them, plants in W, W4G1, and R4G1 grew fastest, followed by those of R4G1B1 and then by those of R3B1, R2B1, R1B1, and R1B6. Although blue light increased tillering number and dry matter production of whole plant, it was not conducive to distribution of dry matter to spikes and grain yield per plant. On the contrary, red light was positively correlated with dry matter distribution and accumulation in spikes. In addition, green light was helpful for the percentage of earbearing tiller, which constituted the number of spikes. Wheat grown in R4G1 had the higher spike number per plant, grain number per spike, and grain weight, leading to the highest grain yield per plant and harvest index. Meanwhile, the starch content, protein content, as well as the nutritional quality and processing quality of wheat flour grown under R4G1 could reach moderate levels. Taken together, appropriate LED's light spectra, such as R4G1, are efficient for wheat cultivation in a controlled environment and make it possible to achieve faster, more, and better winter wheat production.

AB  - Ophiorrhiza pumila is a medicinal plant that grows in subtropical forests and produces camptothecin (CPT). To determine an optimal harvest time of O. pumila in a plant factory with artificial light (PFAL), we investigated the CPT distribution in each organ and at the developmental stage and estimated the annual CPT production. For this study, the O. pumila plants were grown in controlled environments (16 h light period, photosynthetic photon flux density of 100 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) under white light-emitting diode lamps, air temperature of 28 degrees C, relative humidity of 80%, and CO2 concentration of 1000 mu mol mol(-1)). First, the stem, root, and seed pod had higher CPT contents than the leaves, flower, and ovary. The optimal harvest time of O. pumila in a PFAL was 63 days after transplanting (DAT), because the CPT content in the whole organs was the highest at the seed-ripening stage. Second, based on these results, the estimated annual CPT production of O. pumila cultivated in a PFAL was 380 mg m(-2) y(-1) (63 DAT). This value was 4.3 times greater than the annual CPT production by Camptotheca acuminata in a greenhouse. We concluded that the CPT production by O. pumila in a PFAL throughout the year has many advantages, although the demand for electrical energy was high compared to that of Camptotheca acuminata in a greenhouse.

AB  - Maintaining uniform photon irradiance distribution above the plant canopy is a fundamental goal in controlled environment agriculture (CEA). Spatial variation in photon irradiance below the light saturation point will drive differences in individual plant development, decreasing the economic value of the crop. Plant growth is also affected by the spectral composition of light. So far, little attention has been paid to the quantification of the spatial variability in horticultural lighting applications. This work provides a methodology to benchmark and compare lighting installations used in indoor cultivation facilities. We measured the photon irradiance distributions underneath two typical grow light installations using a 10 x 10 measurement grid with 100 mm spacing. We calculated photon irradiance values for each grid point for 100 nm-wide blue, green, red and far-red wavebands covering the 400-800 nm range. We showed that the generally used uniformity metric defined as the minimum to average ratio of PPFD is not appropriate for the characterization of light uniformity in horticultural lighting applications. Instead, we propose to normalize photon irradiance to the maximum, analyze the histograms constructed from relative photon irradiance values and consider the light response of the cultivated crop while comparing the performance of CEA grow systems.

AB  - Simple Summary Indoor crop cultivation systems such as vertical farms or plant factories necessitate artificial lighting. The composition of light quality (i.e., spectral composition) within these systems plays a key role in crop growth and development. Conflicting results on the effects of the light spectrum reported for different plant species and cultivars confirm the specificity of light requirements and the dependency on interacting factors. In this paper, we have therefore investigated how a certain light quality (light with a high share of blue) affects photosynthetic and morphological parameters in two contrasting lettuce cultivars (red and green leaves) with a similar leaf shape and phenotype. The results obtained suggest the occurrence of distinctive morpho-physiological adaptive strategies in green and red pigmented lettuce cultivars to adapt to the higher proportion of blue light environment. Indoor crop cultivation systems such as vertical farms or plant factories necessitate artificial lighting. Light spectral quality can affect plant growth and metabolism and, consequently, the amount of biomass produced and the value of the produce. Conflicting results on the effects of the light spectrum in different plant species and cultivars make it critical to implement a singular lighting solution. In this study we investigated the response of cyanic and acyanic lettuce cultivars to an increased proportion of blue light. For that, we selected a green and a red leaf lettuce cultivar (i.e., 'Aquino', CVg, and 'Barlach', CVr, respectively). The response of both cultivars to long-term blue-enriched light application compared to a white spectrum was analyzed. Plants were grown for 30 days in a growth chamber with optimal environmental conditions (temperature: 20 degrees C, relative humidity: 60%, ambient CO2, photon flux density (PFD) of 260 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) over an 18 h photoperiod). At 15 days after sowing (DAS), white spectrum LEDs (WW) were compared to blue-enriched light (WB; lambda(Peak) = 423 nm) maintaining the same PFD of 260 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). At 30 DAS, both lettuce cultivars adapted to the blue light variant, though the adaptive response was specific to the variety. The rosette weight, light use efficiency, and maximum operating efficiency of PSII photochemistry in the light, F-v/F-m', were comparable between the two light treatments. A significant light quality effect was detected on stomatal density and conductance (20% and 17% increase under WB, respectively, in CVg) and on the modified anthocyanin reflectance index (mARI) (40% increase under WB, in CVr). Net photosynthesis response was generally stronger in CVg compared to CVr; e.g., net photosynthetic rate, P-n, at 1000 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) PPFD increased from WW to WB by 23% in CVg, compared to 18% in CVr. The results obtained suggest the occurrence of distinct physiological adaptive strategies in green and red pigmented lettuce cultivars to adapt to the higher proportion of blue light environment.

AB  - Plant factories and high-tech greenhouses offer the opportunity to modulate plant growth, morphology and qualitative content through the management of artificial light (intensity, photoperiod and spectrum). In this study, three Light Emitting Diode (LED) lighting systems, with blue (B, 460 nm), red (R, 650 nm) and mixed red + green-yellow + blue (RGB) light were used to grow parsley microgreens to understand how light quality could change the phenotype and the profile of secondary metabolites. Plants showed altered morphological characteristics and higher amounts of secondary metabolites under RGB LEDs treatment. The results demonstrated that microgreens under red light showed the highest fresh yield, petiole length, coumaric acid content but also the highest nitrate content. Plants under RGB light showed the highest dry matter percentage and highest content of total and single polyphenols content, while blue light showed the highest ascorbic acid and ABTS antioxidant activity. Moreover, microgreens under red light showed more compact leaves with less intercellular spaces, while under blue and RGB light, the leaves displayed ticker spongy mesophyll with higher percentage of intercellular spaces. Therefore, the specific spectral band was able to modify not only the metabolic profile, but also it could modulate the differentiation of mesophyll cells. Light quality as a preharvest factor helps to shape the final parsley microgreens product as a whole, not only in terms of yield and quality, but also from a morpho-anatomical point of view.

AB  - In this study, the primary (such as amino acids, fatty acids, and minerals) and secondary (including ginsenosides, phenolic acids, and flavonols) metabolites and antioxidant effects of Panax ginseng sprouts (PGSs) by different cultivation systems, such as soil-substrate cultivation (SSC) and deep-water cultivation (DWC), in a plant factory has been observed. There was no significant difference in the total fatty acid (FA) contents. Particularly, the major FAs of PGSs were palmitic acid (207.4 mg/100 g) of saturated FAs and linoleic acid (397.6 mg/100 g) and alpha-linolenic acid (222.6 mg/100 g) of unsaturated FAs in the SSC system. The values of total amino acids were all higher in SSC than in DWC. In the case of ginsenosides, the total protopanaxtriol product was 30.88 mg/g in SSC, while the total protopanaxdiol product was 34.83 mg/g in DWC. In particular, the values of total phenolic acids and total flavonols were 133.36 and 388.19 ug/g, respectively, and SSC had a higher content than DWC. In conclusion, the SSC system was shown to be higher in nutritional constituents and antioxidant activities in soil cultivation, suggesting that PGS with SSC has a positive effect on the quality of PGS in a plant factory.

AB  - Ultraviolet-A (UVA) (315-400 nm) is an essential environmental signal that regulates plant development and affects phytochemicals biosynthesis, including glucosinolate biosynthesis. The effects of different UVA (380 +/- 10 nm, 40 mu mol/m(2)/s) exposure durations, including 0 h/d (UV0), 6 h/d (UV6) and 12 h/d (UV12), on the growth and phytochemicals of Chinese kale (Brassica alboglabra) under white 250 mu mol/m(2)/s LEDs were investigated. UVA exposure of different durations influenced the growth and phytochemicals biosynthesis of Chinese kale. Prolonging UVA irradiation throughout the growth cycle positively affected the growth and the development of Chinese kale, with evident increases in the dry weights of shoots and roots, plant height, stem diameter, specific leaf weight and flower budding rate. The application of UVA increased the soluble sugar content, whereas higher flavonoid content and antioxidant capacity (FRAP) and lower nitrate content were only observed in Chinese kale exposed to UV6 treatment. Besides, the qPCR assay showed that supplemental UVA-radiation exposure up-regulated the gene expressions of UVR8, transcription factors genes and genes related to the glucosinolate biosynthesis pathway, thereby promoting the accumulation of glucosinolates. Therefore, supplemental UVA-radiation exposure for 12 h/d was more conducive to plant growth, while supplemental UVA-radiation exposure for 6 h/d was better for phytochemical biosynthesis in Chinese kale in an artificial-light plant factory.

AB  - Hydroponics is the most widely used technique in closed cultivation environments, and this system is often used for the cultivation of baby leaf vegetables. These species can accumulate high levels of nitrates; for this reason, the control of growing conditions is a crucial factor for limiting their content, especially in protected cultivations. The aim of this work was to reduce nitrate accumulation in leafy vegetables grown in a vertical farm while preserving the quality at harvest as well as during storage. This objective was achieved by completely replacing the nutrient solution with water a few hours before harvest ("flushing"). The trials were carried out on lettuce (Lactuca sativa L. Var. Acephala, cv. Greenet) and rocket (Eruca sativa Mill., cv. Rome). Three independent trials were conducted on lettuce, applying the flushing treatment 24 h and 48 h prior to harvest. One trial was conducted on rocket, applying the treatment 48 h before harvesting. Sampling and related analyses were carried out at harvest and during the storage period to determine chlorophyll, leaf fluorescence, total sugars, chlorophyll (a + b), carotenoids, phenolic index, anthocyanins and nitrate content. Moreover, relative humidity (RH%), O-2% and CO2% determination inside the package headspace were monitored during storage. The results obtained indicate that it is possible to reduce the nitrate concentration by up to 56% in lettuce and 61% in rocket while maintaining the product quality of baby leaves by replacing the nutrient solution with tap water before harvest.

AB  - Global Vertical Farming (VF) applications with characteristic Industry 4.0 connectivity will become more and more relevant as the challenges of food supply continue to increase worldwide. In this work, a cost-effective and portable instrument that enables accurate pH measurements for VF applications is presented. We demonstrate that by performing a well-designed calibration of the sensor, a near Nernstian response, 57.56 [mV/pH], ensues. The system is compared to a ten-fold more expensive laboratory gold standard, and is shown to be accurate in determining the pH of substances in the 2-14 range. The instrument yields precise pH results with an average absolute deviation of 0.06 pH units and a standard deviation of 0.03 pH units. The performance of the instrument is ADC-limited, with a minimum detectable value of 0.028 pH units, and a typical absolute accuracy of +/- 0.062 pH units. By meticulously designing bias and amplification circuitry of the signal conditioning stage, and by optimizing the signal acquisition section of the instrument, a (minimum) four-fold improvement in performance is expected.

AB  - The application of ultraviolet-B (UV-B) irradiation to supplement visible light as an elicitor to increase bioactive compounds under controlled conditions is increasing. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of UV-B dose and wavelength region (280-300 and 300-320 nm) on the morphological, physiological, and biochemical responses of canola plants (Brassica napus L.). Canola plants (17 days after sowing) were subjected to various UV-B intensities (i.e., 0.3, 0.6, and 0.9 W m(-2)) and were divided into cut and non-cut treatments for each UV treatment. Plant growth parameters exhibited different trends based on the treated UV irradiation intensity. Plant growth gradually decreased as the UV irradiation intensity and exposure time increased. Despite the same UV irradiation intensity, plant response varied significantly depending on the presence or absence of a short-wavelength cut filter (<300 nm). Canola plants suffered more leaf damage in nonfilter treatments containing shorter wavelengths (280-300 nm). UV treatment effectively activates the expression of secondary metabolite biosynthetic genes, differing depending on the UV irradiation intensity. Our results suggest that both UV irradiation intensity and wavelength should be considered when enhancing antioxidant phytochemicals without inhibiting plant growth in a plant factory with artificial light.

AB  - Red beet (Beta vulgaris L.) is a root vegetable consumed and cultivated all around the world. It contains plenty of sugars, inorganic ions and a variety of secondary metabolites known to improve human health. The aim of this work was to investigate the effect of light spectra on red beets and their components in a vertical farm (VF) compared to open field (OF). RED (red:blue-white = 4:1)-treated shoots elevated total phenolic contents (TPC) among lights. Sugar content in VF red beets was 4.2 times higher than beets from OF. Betalains in VF red beets were 2.4-2.8 times higher than OF ones, and RED-treated roots had significantly higher betalain levels compared to CON (red:blue-white = 2:1)-treated ones. VF red beets contained a higher level of inorganic nitrates and lower chloride compared to OF beets. In conclusion, the light spectrum alters the concentration of beet components to be higher than that of OF red beets, and RED light elevated TPC, sugars and betalains.

AB  - Simple Summary The growth and nutrient utilization of hydroponic vegetables are largely affected by the nutrient solution management method and light environment. This study was conducted to improve the growth, nutrient absorption efficiency, and nutrient use efficiency of basil plants grown in a plant factory with artificial lighting by controlling the nutrient solution management method and light spectrum. Basil plants were treated with 4 applied nutrient quantities and three red:blue ratios from transplanting to harvest (20 days). Results showed that low applied nutrient quantity significantly improved the nutrient use efficiency and nutrient absorption efficiency. Furthermore, the yield of the basil plant and the absorption of N and K were significantly influenced by different red:blue ratios under low applied nutrient quantity treatments. Therefore, this study has determined the optimal combination of the applied nutrient quantity and red:blue ratio for improving the growth, nutrient use efficiency, and nutrient absorption efficiency of basil plants. The findings of this study can be applied to hydroponic basil production for saving resources and protecting the environment. Quantitative nutrient management has advantages, such as saving resources and improving nutrient utilization, compared with the conventional electrical conductivity management method. The growth and nutrient utilization of vegetables are affected by the integrated environmental conditions such as nutrient supply and light spectrum. This study investigated the effects of applied nutrient quantity (ANQ) (0.5, 1, 2, and 4 times (T) the absorption quantity of nutrients determined in the preliminary experiment, indicated by 0.5T, 1T, 2T, and 4T, respectively) in nutrient solution and red:blue ratio (R:B = 3:7, 7:3, and 9:1, indicated by RB3:7, RB7:3, and RB9:1, respectively) on the growth and nutrient utilization of basil plants in a plant factory with artificial lighting. Results demonstrated that the nutrient use efficiency (NUE) and the nutrient absorption efficiency (NAE) were significantly increased by the ANQ of 0.5T compared with the treatments of 1T, 2T, and 4T, irrespective of R:B ratios. Furthermore, under the ANQ of 0.5T, RB7:3 significantly increased the yield and the absorption of N and K of the basil plant compared with other R:B ratios. Therefore, the ANQ of 0.5T combined with RB7:3 was considered the optimal combination to improve the yield, NUE, and NAE of basil plants in the present study.

AB  - Plant production systems such as plant factories and greenhouses can help promote resilience in food production. These systems could be used for plant protection and aid in controlling the micro- and macro- environments needed for optimal plant growth irrespective of natural disasters and changing climate conditions. However, to ensure optimal environmental controls and efficient production, several technologies such as sensors and robots have been developed and are at different stages of implementation. New and improved systems are continuously being investigated and developed with technological advances such as robotics, sensing, and artificial intelligence to mitigate hazards to humans working in these systems from poor ventilation and harsh weather while improving productivity. These technological advances necessitate frequent retrofits considering local contexts such as present and projected labor costs. The type of agricultural products also affects measures to be implemented to maximize returns on investment. Consequently, we formulated the retrofitting problem for plant production systems considering two objectives; minimizing the total cost for retrofitting and maximizing the yearly net profit. Additionally, we considered the following: (a) cost of new technologies; (b) present and projected cost for human labor and robotics; (c) size and service life of the plant production system; (d) productivity before and after retrofit, (e) interest on loans for retrofitting, (f) energy consumption before and after retrofit and, (g) replacement and maintenance cost of systems. We solved this problem using a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm that results in a set of compromised solutions and performed several simulations to demonstrate the applicability and robustness of the method. Results showed up to a 250% increase in annual net profits in an investigated case, indicating that the availability of all the possible retrofitting combinations would improve decision making. A user-friendly system was developed to provide all the feasible retrofitting combinations and total costs with the yearly return on investment in agricultural production systems in a single run.

AB  - Common ice plant (Mesembryanthemum crystallinum L.) is a novel edible plant with a succulent and savory flavor emerging as new crop for greenhouse and plant factory growers. Currently very limited information is available on the response of ice plant to photoperiod and to daily light integral (DLI). The objective of this study was to determine the impact of photoperiod/DLI on the growth of ice plant for indoor vertical production. Four-week old seedlings of ice plant were transplanted into vertical hydroponic systems and given five photoperiod/DLI treatments: 8/6.3, 12/9.5, 16/12.7, 20/15.8, and 24/19.0 h/mol center dot m(-2)center dot d(-1). Sequential destructive harvests to determine plant growth occurred 14, 21, and 28 days after lighting treatments began. Plants performed better with increasing photoperiod/DLI from 8 h/6.3 mol center dot m(-2)center dot d(-1) to 20 h/15.8 mol center dot m(-2)center dot d(-1). By day 28, shoot fresh weight increased from 160 g to 639 g as the photoperiod/DLI increased from 8 h/6.3 mol center dot m(-2)center dot d(-1) to 20 h/15.8 mol center dot m(-2)center dot d(-1). The continuous lighting treatment, 24 h/19 mol center dot m(-2)center dot d(-1), showed a negative effect on the plant fresh weight (FW) and dry weight (DW). Light treatment did not have obvious effects on shoot:root ratio and macronutrient uptake except that potassium (K) uptake decreased slightly with increased photoperiod/DLI. Plants receiving higher photoperiod/DLI showed the same number of leaves (indicating the same development stage) but had smaller, thicker, and darker green leaves compared to lower photoperiod/DLI treatments. Leaf water content was not affected by light treatment up to 20 h/15.8 mol center dot m(-2)center dot d(-1) but decreased at 24 h/19 mol center dot m(-2)center dot d(-1). Further research is needed to separate the physiological response of increasing/continuous photoperiod from the response of increasing DLI.

AB  - Vertical farming is a relatively new fresh fruit and vegetable production system, where lamps (mostly light emitting diodes [LED]) are the sole light source. A high light use efficiency (LUEinc), defined as shoot dry weight per incident photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD; g mol(-1)) integral, is crucial for the economic viability of vertical farming. Very different values for LUEinc have been reported in the literature and it is not clear whether LUEinc is higher in vertical farming than in greenhouse or open field cultivation. Values of LUEinc of lettuce grown in a vertical farm (53 studies), greenhouse (13 studies) and open field (8 studies) were collected from literature, as well as relevant cultivation aspects such as lettuce weight at harvest, cultivation period (plant age at harvest), daily light integral, cumulative daily light integral for the whole cultivation period, planting density and CO2 concentration. The average LUEinc for lettuce grown in a vertical farm was 0.55 g mol(-1) which was higher than 0.39 g mol(-1) for greenhouse-grown lettuce. Both were substantially higher than for field-grown lettuce (0.23 g mol(-1)). The maximum measured LUEinc for lettuce grown in a vertical farm (1.63 g mol(-1)) is close to the published maximum theoretical value, which ranges from 1.26 to 1.81 g mol(-1). Since all environmental factors can be fully controlled, vertical farming has the capability to achieve the theoretical maximum LUEinc. Using the highest reported LUEinc based on shoot fresh weight (44 g mol(-1) at 200 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) PPFD and 16 h photoperiod), it is estimated that each layer of a vertical farm can potentially produce annually up to 700 kg of lettuce per m(2) at 500 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) of continuous light.

AB  - Watercress (Nasturtium officinale R. Br.) is a highly nutritious leafy crop with a rich health-related phytonutrient profile including secondary plant metabolites such as glucosinolates. This semi-aquatic crop is well-suited for indoor hydroponic cultivation and has a growing market for its distinctive peppery taste and health benefits. We describe crop trials in three contrasting environments and report the changes to plant morphology, yield, and nutritional profile under varying blue light treatments. Yield and glucosinolate quantity were significantly increased in a vertical farm system enriched in blue light, relative to field-grown crops. Additionally, PBITC, a glucosinolate not previously identified in field-grown watercress, was found in plants grown in a vertical farm. This work demonstrates the great potential of watercress in a new era of controlled environment agriculture to deliver improved health benefits to customers.

AB  - Irradiation with artificial lighting in greenhouses and plant factories is mainly used to promote photosynthesis in tomato cultivation. In addition to photosynthesis, the light effects on morphology, flowering, and metabolism are also crucial as plant responses. Light period and quality have been studied for a long time in relation to the flowering of cut-flowers, strawberries, and many leafy vegetables. Light quality, such as red, far-red, and blue, should be considered with their photoreceptors containing phytochrome, cryptochrome, and flavin-binding kelch repeat, F-box 1. Light quality may also affect plant morphogenesis and the accumulation of valuable metabolites, and plant growth regulators (PGRs) are understandably related to them. However, the effects of PGRs, light quality, and photoreceptors on morphogenesis and metabolite accumulation have been only reported individually and have not been comprehensively discussed. In this review, the information on tomatoes, which are important both industrially and academically, was mainly summarized and discussed. Effects of light quality on plant growth, fruit ripening and metabolite accumulation, and biotic and abiotic stresses, as well as the involvement of gibberellin, auxin, ethylene, abscisic acid, jasmonic acid, and salicylic acid, are discussed here with the roles of the photoreceptors of each light quality and light signal integrators. There is no safety problem for light quality use with appropriate wavelength and intensity, and it is environmentally friendly to use light emitting diodes as an energy-saving light source. Therefore, once their effect is clear with scientific evidence in relation to PGRs, light quality control technology can be used and contribute to the improvement of production and quality of tomatoes with the usage of PGRs.

AB  - Operational research is the scientific discipline - widespread in sciences like engineering, economics, sociology, politics - that applies advanced analytical methods to assist in decision-making. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the value of such methods to the research of the carbon footprint produced by vertical farms, in specific its decrease in regard to the pre- and post-operational energy consumption and cost that occurs throughout their lifecycle. A logistic structure was designed, dependent on specific parameters, such as the space, location, and fuel of the hydroponic unit that change during the research. This way, multiple possible scenarios could be studied. The results of each scenario were analysed and compared via a linear multi-criteria model. The results demonstrated strong dependencies (and softer links) between particular parameters, such as the choice of space and the food miles required for the product.

AB  - This paper investigates what investments in shorter supply chains, especially post-outbreak (COVID), mean in relation to broader agrifood corporatization trends. The paper draws from 25 interviews with individuals connected to large-scale vertical farming operations in the US and Canada, from investors and executives of vertical agriculture firms to managers of restaurants and grocery stores that sourced from capital-intensive indoor farms. The spatial fix literature is used to interrogate this push to pursue local food in COVID's shadow through capital-intensive vertical agriculture, noting these farms are as much about a time as they are about a place.

AB  - As demand for food production continues to rise, it is clear that in order to meet the challenges of the future in terms of food security and environmental sustainability, radical changes are required throughout all levels of the global food system. Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA) (a.k.a. indoor farming) has an advantage over conventional farming methods in that production processes can be largely separated from the natural environment, thus, production is less reliant on environmental conditions, and pollution can be better restricted and controlled. While output potential of conventional farming at a global scale is predicted to suffer due to the effects of climate change, technological advancements in this time will drastically improve both the economic and environmental performance of CEA systems. This article summarizes the current understanding and gaps in knowledge surrounding the environmental sustainability of CEA systems, and assesses whether these systems may allow for intensive and fully sustainable agriculture at a global scale. The energy requirements and subsequent carbon footprint of many systems is currently the greatest environmental hurdle to overcome. The lack of economically grown staple crops which make up the majority of calories consumed by humans is also a major limiting factor in the expansion of CEA systems to reduce the environmental impacts of food production at a global scale. This review introduces the concept of Integrated System CEA (ISCEA) in which multiple CEA systems can be deployed in an integrated localized fashion to increase efficiency and reduce environmental impacts of food production. We conclude that it is feasible that with sufficient green energy, that ISCEA systems could largely negate most forms of environmental damage associated with conventional farming at a global scale (e.g., GHGs, deforestation, nitrogen, phosphorus, pesticide use, etc.). However, while there is plenty of research being carried out into improving energy efficiency, renewable energy and crop diversification in CEA systems, the circular economy approach to waste is largely ignored. We recommend that industries begin to investigate how nutrient flows and efficiencies in systems can be better managed to improve the environmental performance of CEA systems of the future.

AB  - Ultraviolet-B (UV-B, 280-315 nm) radiation has been known as an elicitor to enhance bioactive compound contents in plants. However, unpredictable yield is an obstacle to the application of UV-B radiation to controlled environments such as plant factories. A typical three-dimensional (3D) plant structure causes uneven UV-B exposure with leaf position and age-dependent sensitivity to UV-B radiation. The purpose of this study was to develop a model for predicting phenolic accumulation in kale (Brassica oleracea L. var. acephala) according to UV-B radiation interception and growth stage. The plants grown under a plant factory module were exposed to UV-B radiation from UV-B light-emitting diodes with a peak at 310 nm for 6 or 12 h at 23, 30, and 38 days after transplanting. The spatial distribution of UV-B radiation interception in the plants was quantified using ray-tracing simulation with a 3D-scanned plant model. Total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), total anthocyanin content (TAC), UV-B absorbing pigment content (UAPC), and the antioxidant capacity were significantly higher in UV-B-exposed leaves. Daily UV-B energy absorbed by leaves and developmental age was used to develop stepwise multiple linear regression models for the TPC, TFC, TAC, and UAPC at each growth stage. The newly developed models accurately predicted the TPC, TFC, TAC, and UAPC in individual leaves with R-2 > 0.78 and normalized root mean squared errors of approximately 30% in test data, across the three growth stages. The UV-B energy yields for TPC, TFC, and TAC were the highest in the intermediate leaves, while those for UAPC were the highest in young leaves at the last stage. To the best of our knowledge, this study proposed the first statistical models for estimating UV-B-induced phenolic contents in plant structure. These results provided the fundamental data and models required for the optimization process. This approach can save the experimental time and cost required to optimize the control of UV-B radiation.

AB  - Simple Summary Vertical farming systems (VFS) have great potential for improving crop productivity but are energy-intensive, since light, temperature, and humidity each need to be controlled. In this review, we consider the challenges of incorporating renewable energy into VFS and highlight how light spectra, intensity, and daylength can be varied to influence the quality of crops. We propose that insights from plant photobiology can be utilised to optimise energy efficiency in this rapidly evolving sector. Intensive agriculture is essential to feed increasing populations, yet requires large amounts of pesticide, fertiliser, and water to maintain productivity. One solution to mitigate these issues is the adoption of Vertical Farming Systems (VFS). The self-contained operation of these facilities offers the potential to recycle agricultural inputs, as well as sheltering crops from the effects of climate change. Recent technological advancements in light-emitting diode (LED) lighting technology have enabled VFS to become a commercial reality, although high electrical consumption continues to tarnish the environmental credentials of the industry. In this review, we examine how the inherent use of electricity by VFS can be leveraged to deliver commercial and environmental benefits. We propose that an understanding of plant photobiology can be used to vary VFS energy consumption in coordination with electrical availability from the grid, facilitating demand-side management of energy supplies and promoting crop yield.

AB  - Different intensities of UV-A (6, 12, 18 mu mol center dot m(-2)s(-1)) were applied in a plant factory to evaluate the combined influences of supplemental UV-A and red and blue light (Red:Blue = 1:1 at PPFD of 250 mu mol center dot m(-2) s(-1)) on the biomass, antioxidant activity and phytochemical accumulation of kale. Supplemental UV-A treatments (T1: 6 mu mol center dot m(-2) s(-1), T2: 12 mu mol center dot m(-2) s(-1) and T3: 18 mu mol center dot m(-2) s(-1)) resulted in higher moisture content, higher pigment content, and greater leaf area of kale while T2 reached its highest point. T2 treatment positively enhanced the antioxidant capacity, increased the contents of soluble protein, soluble sugar and reduced the nitrate content. T1 treatment markedly increased the content of aliphatic glucosinolate (GSL), whereas T2 treatment highly increased the contents of indolic GSL and total GSL. Genes related to GSL biosynthesis were down-regulated in CK and T3 treatments, while a majority of them were greatly up-regulated by T1 and T2. Hence, supplemental 12 mu mol center dot m(-2) s(-1) UV-A might be a promising strategy to enhance the growth and quality of kale in a plant factory.

AB  - The use of closed growth environments, such as greenhouses, plant factories, and vertical farms, represents a sustainable alternative for fresh food production. Closed plant production systems (CPPSs) allow growing of any plant variety, no matter the year's season. Artificial lighting plays an essential role in CPPSs as it promotes growth by providing optimal conditions for plant development. Nevertheless, it is a model with a high demand for electricity, which is required for artificial radiation systems to enhance the developing plants. A high percentage (40% to 50%) of the costs in CPPSs point to artificial lighting systems. Due to this, lighting strategies are essential to improve sustainability and profitability in closed plant production systems. However, no tools have been applied in the literature to contribute to energy savings in LED-type artificial radiation systems through the configuration of light recipes (wavelengths combination. For CPPS to be cost-effective and sustainable, a pre-evaluation of energy consumption for plant cultivation must consider. Artificial intelligence (AI) methods integrated into the prediction crucial variables such as each input-variable light color or specific wavelengths like red, green, blue, and white along with light intensity (quantity), frequency (pulsed light), and duty cycle. This paper focuses on the feature-selection stage, in which a regression model is trained to predict energy consumption in LED lights with specific light recipes in CPPSs. This stage is critical because it identifies the most representative features for training the model, and the other stages depend on it. These tools can enable further in-depth analysis of the energy savings that can be obtained with light recipes and pulsed and continuous operation light modes in artificial LED lighting systems.

AB  - ABS T R A C T Indoor vertical farming is currently a breakthrough horticultural production system. However, for fruit bearing crops such as strawberry, a major challenge is optimizing light spectral composition to control flowering. We have shown that it is possible to stimulate flowering and fruit development with different light treatments in the day-neutral strawberry accessions Fragaria vesca 'Yellow Wonder' YW5AF7 and 'Hawaii-4'. We used blue (449 nm) and far-red (740 nm) light in a background of sunlight-mimicking photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) under both long-and short-day photoperiods. Flower induction was most successful when blue light was given during the night and far-red light was given for 24 h. These light treatments overruled the photoperiodic control of flowering. Both light treatments boosted flowering, leading to a higher fruit yield, with minor effects on vegetative plant growth. We also evaluated the role of FvCO and FvFT1 using expression analysis and RNAi lines, and revealed that both blue and far-red light treatments trigger flowering in part through the conserved FvCO and FvFT1 cascade. Blue light operates through FvFT1, partially independently of FvCO, while far-red light operates independently of FvCO. Furthermore, using transcriptional reporter lines of FvFT1, we found that FvFT1 is ontogenetically and tissue-specifically regulated, being exclusively expressed in the veins of older leaves, and induced predominantly by blue and far-red light.

AB  - Vertical farming (VF) is a potential solution for producing high-quality, accessible, and climate-friendly nutrition for growing urban populations. However, to realize VF's potential as a sustainable food source, innovative technologies are required to ensure that VF can be industrialized on a massive scale and extended beyond leafy greens and fruits into the production of food staples or row crops. While technological advances have improved the energy efficiency of VF lighting systems, there has been insufficient research into biostimulation as an approach to reduce energy needs and improve crop quality and yield. We conducted a controlled trial to investigate the application of a phycocyanin-rich Spirulina extract (PRSE) as a biostimulant in hydroponically grown, vertically farmed lettuce (Salanova (R) Lactuca sativa and Salanova (R) Red Crisp). Phenotype analysis for Salanova (R) Red Crisp with PRSE application showed a reduced time from seed to harvest by 6 days, increased yield by 12.5%, and improved antioxidant flavonoid levels. Metagenomic analysis of the microbial community of the nutrient solution for Salanova (R) Lactuca sativa cultivation indicated a 62% reduction in the bacterial population for the PRSE treatment group (vs. 0.017% increase for the control group). An increase in the overall bacterial diversity and evenness was found in the PRSE treatment group as compared to a decrease in these parameters for the control group. This preliminary study reveals the utility of PRSE for plant growth promotion, improvement in crop yield, and potential prebiotic activity in hydroponic vertical farming. Moreover, it demonstrates that microalgae-derived biostimulants may play an important role in improving the economic and environmental sustainability of VF.

AB  - Indoor farming is one approach to face future challenges in agricultural and horticultural production. The scalable technology of indoor farming makes not only large commercial production systems but also small-scale home indoor farms (HIFs) available, which enable private consumers to produce their own leafy greens and herbs with minimal effort. The increasing relevance of HIFs can be verified by scientific work regarding the consumer attitude and several start-ups which develop those systems. However, the economic feasibility of HIFs is unknown. To answer this question, this paper followed a broad approach. An investment analysis was conducted for 36 HIFs with data freely obtained from online retailers. Depending on the consumables' selection, around 40% of those systems can reach a positive net present value. The number of HIFs with a positive economic outcome could be further increased by changing the production pattern and the possibility of several harvests per plug and seed instead of only one destructive harvest. Consequently, with indoor farming, the variety of competing actors in specific horticultural sectors could raise in the future.

AB  - Accurate recognition of cherry tomatoes is a key issue for the automatic picking system in plant factories, which helps to improve picking efficiency and reduce production costs. By using the depth information and considering the prior adjacent constraint between the fruit and the stem of cherry tomatoes, this paper proposes an improved Mask R-CNN for visual recognition of cherry tomatoes. Firstly, the input layer of the network is modified to achieve dual-mode data fusion of RGB and depth images. Secondly, by constructing the corresponding region generation network to indicate the integral constraint between the fruit and the stem, false recognition of branches is reduced. Thirdly, a multi-class prediction subnetwork is used to decouple the pixel-level category predictions of fruit and stem. Meanwhile, multi-task loss balance and adaptive feature pooling are adopted to overcome the limitation caused by the size difference between fruit and stem. The experimental results show that the improved Mask R-CNN achieved an accuracy of 93.76% for fruit recognition, which is 11.53% and 15.5% higher than that of the standard Mask R-CNN and YOLACT, and it achieves an accuracy of 89.34% for stem recognition, which is 13.91% and 19.7% higher than that of the standard Mask R-CNN and YOLACT, respectively. Besides, the recall rate of the proposed method for stem recognition is 94.47%, which is 11.53% and 8.3% higher than that of YOLACT and Mask R-CNN, respectively. In addition, the proposed method takes only 0.04 s to process a single image, providing an efficient approach for automatically picking cherry tomatoes in plant factories.

AB  - Building-integrated rooftop greenhouses (BiRTGs) are innovative vertical farms consisting of a greenhouse on the roof of a building. BiRTGs can provide environmental benefits by recycling energy, carbon dioxide, and water between the greenhouse and the building. Moreover, BiRTGs can reduce cooling and heating loads by reducing the exposure of the building surface to heat gains/losses through the roof. However, the benefits of BiRTGs have not yet been completely elucidated from an energy perspective. This study aimed to analyse the energy-saving efficiency of BiRTGs using building energy simulations (BES) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques. BES is a calculation method for analysing the heating and cooling loads of buildings; however, it was difficult to consider time-dependent changes in the ventilation characteristics in the BES model. CFD can be used to calculate more detailed ventilation characteristics of an experimental facility. Thus, CFD and the BES were combined to obtain more accurate BES-based data. The BES-computed annual energy load for a single-span greenhouse in which tomatoes were grown was 490,128 MJ, whereas the annual energy load for growing tomatoes in a BiRTG resulted in a 5.2% reduction, on average (464,673 MJ). The energy-saving effects were positive from October to April because the BiRTG helped transmit heat energy transmitted from the building to the greenhouse. Regarding the total energy load in the BiRTG after alternating the air temperature management (ATM), the heating energy load was reduced in the winter. ATM was expected to apply from November to March, with average energy savings of 11.8%.

AB  - Plant factory, a new agricultural planting technology, has emerged and rapidly grown in recent years, with phosphor conversion light emitting diodes (pc-LEDs) considered as the first choice of source light for the plant factory. In this study, a new type of Cr3+-activated Li2MgTi3O8 phosphor (LMT: Cr3+) was synthesized by high temperature solid state method. X-Ray diffraction patterns showed that there was no detectable impurity in these samples. The photoluminescence spectra revealed that this phosphor can emit far-red light with the peak at 740 nm excited by ultraviolet and blue light, overlapped well with the PFR. After introducing Zn2+ ions (LMT: Cr3+ , Zn2+), the luminescence intensity increases by 46% mainly due to the increase of lattice distortion, and internal quantum yield was improved from 25.4% to 41.3% under 365 nm excitation. Finally, the pc-LED devices, consisting of 470 nm chip coated with the optimal phosphor, exhibited good luminescence and overlapping with P-FR. These results indicate that the LMT: Cr3+, Zn2+ phosphor has the potential application in modern agriculture. (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In order to realize the intelligent online yield estimation of tomato in the plant factory with artificial lighting (PFAL), a recognition method of tomato red fruit and green fruit based on improved yolov3 deep learning model was proposed to count and estimate tomato fruit yield under natural growth state. According to the planting environment and facility conditions of tomato plants, a computer vision system for fruit counting and yield estimation was designed and the new position loss function was based on the generalized intersection over union (GIoU), which improved the traditional YOLO algorithm loss function. Meanwhile, the scale invariant feature could promote the description precision of the different shapes of fruits. Based on the construction and labeling of the sample image data, the K-means clustering algorithm was used to obtain nine prior boxes of different specifications which were assigned according to the hierarchical level of the feature map. The experimental results of model training and evaluation showed that the mean average precision (mAP) of the improved detection model reached 99.3%, which was 2.7% higher than that of the traditional YOLOv3 model, and the processing time for a single image declined to 15 ms. Moreover, the improved YOLOv3 model had better identification effects for dense and shaded fruits. The research results can provide yield estimation methods and technical support for the research and development of intelligent control system for planting fruits and vegetables in plant factories, greenhouses and fields.

AB  - Recent years have seen an increased effort in the detection of plant stresses and diseases using non-invasive sensors and deep learning methods. Nonetheless, no studies have been made on dense plant canopies, due to the difficulty in automatically zooming into each plant, especially in outdoor conditions. Zooming in and zooming out is necessary to focus on the plant stress and to precisely localize the stress within the canopy, for further analysis and intervention. This work concentrates on tip-burn, which is a plant stress affecting lettuce grown in controlled environmental conditions, such as in plant factories. We present a new method for tip-burn stress detection and localization, combining both classification and self-supervised segmentation to detect, localize, and closely segment the stressed regions. Starting with images of a dense canopy collecting about 1,000 plants, the proposed method is able to zoom into the tip-burn region of a single plant, covering less than 1/10th of the plant itself. The method is crucial for solving the manual phenotyping that is required in plant factories. The precise localization of the stress within the plant, of the plant within the tray, and of the tray within the table canopy allows to automatically deliver statistics and causal annotations. We have tested our method on different data sets, which do not provide any ground truth segmentation mask, neither for the leaves nor for the stresses; therefore, the results on the self-supervised segmentation is even more impressive. Results show that the accuracy for both classification and self supervised segmentation is new and efficacious. Finally, the data set used for training test and validation is currently available on demand.

AB  - Vertical farming (VF) is a method of indoor agricultural production, involving stacked layers of crops, utilising technologies to increase yields per unit area. However, this emerging sector has struggled with profitability and a high failure rate. Practitioners and academics call for a comprehensive economic analysis of vertical farming, but efforts have been stifled by a lack of valid and available data as existing studies are unable to address risks and uncertainty that may support risk-empowered business planning. An adaptable economic analysis is necessary that considers imprecise variables and risks. The financial risk analysis presented uses with a first-hitting-time model with probability bounds to evaluate quasi-insolvency for two unique vertical farms. The UK farm results show that capital injection, robust data collection, frequent cleaning, efficient distribution and cheaper packaging are pathways to profitability and have a safer risk profile. For the Japanese farm, diversification of revenue streams like tours or education reduce financial risk associated with yield and sales. This is the first instance of applying risk and uncertainty quantification for VF business models and it can support wider agricultural projects. Enabling this complex sector to compute with uncertainty to estimate financials could improve access to funding and help other nascent industries.

AB  - Resources such as fertile soil and clean water are already limited in many parts of the world. Additionally, the conventional use of arable land is becoming increasingly difficult, which is further exacerbated by climate change. Soilless cultivation systems do not only offer the opportunity to save water and cultivate without soil but also the chance to open up urban areas such as residential rooftops for food production in close proximity to consumers. In this review, applications of soilless farming systems are identified and compared to conventional agriculture. Furthermore, aspects of economic viability, sustainability and current developments are investigated. An insight into the most important soilless farming systems-hydroponics, aquaponics and vertical farming-is provided. The systems are then differentiated from each other and, as far as possible, evaluated in terms of their environmental impact and compared with conventional cultivation methods. Comparing published data analyzing the yield of hydroponic cultivation systems in comparison to soil-based cultivation methods enables a basic overview of the profitability of both methods and, thus, lays the foundation for future research and practical applications. The most important inert substrates for hydroponic applications are presented, and their degree of sustainability is compared in order to emphasize environmental impacts and affect substrate selections of future projects. Based on an assessment of the most important soilless cultivation systems, the challenges and developments of current techniques are highlighted and discussed.

AB  - Vertical farms are to be considered the future of agriculture given that they not only use space and resources efficiently but can also consistently produce large yields. Recently, artificial intelligence has been introduced for use in vertical farms to boost crop yields, and crop growth monitoring is an essential example of the type of automation necessary to manage a vertical farm system. Region of interest predictions are generally used to find crop regions from the color images captured by a camera for the monitoring of growth. However, most deep learning-based prediction approaches are associated with performance degradation issues in the event of high crop densities or when different types of crops are grown together. To address this problem, we introduce a novel method, termed pseudo crop mixing, a model training strategy that targets vertical farms. With a small amount of labeled crop data, the proposed method can achieve optimal performance. This is particularly advantageous for crops with a long growth period, and it also reduces the cost of constructing a dataset that must be frequently updated to support the various crops in existing systems. Additionally, the proposed method demonstrates robustness with new data that were not introduced during the learning process. This advantage can be used for vertical farms that can be efficiently installed and operated in a variety of environments, and because no transfer learning was required, the construction time for container-type vertical farms can be reduced. In experiments, we show that the proposed model achieved a performance of 76.9%, which is 12.5% better than the existing method with a dataset obtained from a container-type indoor vertical farm. Our codes and dataset will be available publicly.

AB  - In this study, a comparative economic analysis was conducted for typical greenhouses, plant factories with natural and artificial light, and those with only artificial light, based on the insulation, artificial light, and photovoltaic (PV) installation costs. In addition, the results of research on primary energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the use of fossil fuels were presented. By comparing the case-wise annual energy consumption, when all energy sources were converted into primary energy consumption based on the applied coefficients for collection, transport, and processing, to unify calculations for different fossil fuel energy sources, the case of the installed PV systems exhibited large reductions, of 424% and 340%, in terms of primary energy consumption and GHG emissions, respectively. Furthermore, electric heating resulted in higher primary energy consumption and GHG emissions than oil. When the economic analysis included the plant factory installation cost used to maintain the temperature required for plant growth in winter, the PV installation exhibited the highest cost; additionally, all plant factories showed an investment payback period of seven to nine years, which is comparable to typical greenhouses. Based on these results, we aim to reduce the use of fossil fuels for sustainable energy by combining architectural technology for improved energy performance in the agricultural environment.

AB  - Pakchoi, a popular leafy vegetable in China, is expected to be planted in plant factories with artificial lighting (PFALs). In order to examine the effects of different red and blue light ratios (R:B ratio) on growth, photosynthesis, and absorption spectrum of plant leaves, and to analyze the energy use efficiency, the pakchoi (Brassica Chinensis L. cv. Xiazhijiao) was cultivated hydroponically under white LEDs with R:B ratios of 0.9 (L0.9) and 1.8 (L1.8), white plus red LEDs with R:B ratios of 2.7 (L2.7) and 4.0 (L4.0) for 40 d, respectively. The results showed that the leaf length and width were significantly greater in the L0.9 treatment than in other treatments, and the dry weight per plant increased by over 33% when R:B ratio decreased from 4.0 to 0.9. The net photosynthesis rates of pakchoi leaves ranged from 9.2 to 9.6 ??mol/(m2??s) under different lighting conditions, which had no significant difference. The biggest difference in the spectrum absorptance of pakchoi leaves was expressed in green light waveband, and the highest absorption of plant leaves was under L0.9 and L1.8 treatments. The light energy use efficiency (LUE), photon yield (PY), and energy yield (EY) in L0.9 were over 25% higher than that in the other treatments, while there was no significant difference in the electrical energy use efficiency (EUE). In conclusion, an optimal light quality to cultivate pakchoi in PFALs was the white LEDs with R:B ratio of 0.9, and this finding could provide a promising lighting environment to hydroponic pakchoi yield and energy use efficiency.

AB  - A plant factory with artificial light (PFAL) is defined as an advanced agricultural production system with a precisely controlled environment, playing an important role in vertical farming and urban food supply. Artificial light is one of the core technologies in PFALs and accounts for a large part of energy consumption; elevating the light utilization efficiency of plants is vital for the sustainable development of PFALs. Meanwhile, the enclosed structure of the plant factory resulted in the independence of its light environment, indicating that the light environment in PFALs can be custom-made. Lighting strategy is an attempt to reprogram the light environmental parameters in unconventional ways, resulting in innovative lighting modes for energy-saving, high-yield, and high-quality production in PFALs. This article reviewed the recent endeavors aiming to increase light conversion efficiency and nutritive properties of crops by different lighting strategies, providing economic irradiation patterns or modes for various PFALs production goals.

AB  - In this study, the effect of different photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) provided by LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes) and photoperiod on biomass production, morphological traits, photosynthetic performance, sensory attributes, and image texture parameters of indoor cultivated romaine lettuce was evaluated. Two cultivars of lettuce Lactuca sativa var. longifolium namely 'Casual' (Syngenta)-midi romaine lettuce with medium-compact heads-and 'Elizium' (Enza Zaden)-a mini type (Little Gem) with compact heavy heads-were used. PPFD of 160 and 240 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) and photoperiod of 16 and 20 h were applied, and Daily Light Integral (DLI) values were 9.2, 11.5, 13.8, and 17.3 mol m(-2) day(-1). The experiment lasted 30 days in the Indoor Controlled Environment Agriculture facility. DLI equal to 17.3 mol m(-2) per day for cv. 'Casual' and 11.5-17.3 mol m(-2) per day for cv. 'Elizium' allowed to obtain a very high fresh weight, 350 and 240 g, respectively, within 30 days of cultivation in an indoor plant production facility. The application of the lowest PPFD 160 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) and 16 h photoperiod (9.2 mol m(-2) per day DLI) resulted in the lowest fresh weight, the number of leaves and head circumference. The level of nitrate, even at the lowest DLI, was below the limit imposed by European Community Regulation. The cv. 'Elizium' lettuce grown at PPFD 240 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) and 16 h photoperiod had the highest overall sensory quality. The cv. 'Casual' lettuce grown at PPFD 160 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) and 20 h photoperiod had the lowest sensory quality. The samples subjected to different photoperiod and PPFD were also successively distinguished in an objective and non-destructive way using image features and machine learning algorithms. The average accuracy for the leaf samples of cv. 'Casual' lettuce reached 98.75% and for cv. 'Elizium' cultivar-86.25%. The obtained relationship between DLI and yield, as well as the quality of romaine lettuce, can be used in practice to improve romaine lettuce production in an Indoor Controlled Environment.

AB  - The increasing demand for agricultural products and scarcity of resources, such as soil fertility, irrigation water, and moderate climate, have driven increased use of indoor vertical farming systems. In this paper, a three-dimensional numerical model is developed to optimize air flow and heat transfer within an indoor system considering transpiration, carbon-dioxide consumption, and oxygen production. The near-wall RNG k - epsilon turbulent model is implemented to consider the impacts of turbulence and obstacles in the computational domain. To assess the degree of uniformity affecting each tray, an objective uniformity parameter is developed based on the deviation of flow velocity over cultivation trays with respect to the optimal flow velocity. Further, an efficiency parameter is defined based on relative humidity, temperature, and pressure drop to holistically compare the effectiveness of flow inlet and outlet locations. Accordingly, eight designs are studied extensively and one case is found to be the most efficient with an objective uniformity of 91.7% due to high degree of spiral flow circulation. Most importantly, the results suggest that some cases even with low mass flow rates are capable of providing uniform flow distribution, which can significantly reduce energy consumption of indoor vertical farming systems. This newly developed model is proven to be an effective tool for investigating the heat transfer rate and fluid flow uniformity and optimizing cultivation environment for an indoor vertical farming system.

AB  - Kalanchoe (Kalanchoe blossfeldiana) is a qualitative short-day plant with a high aesthetic value. When the night length is less than a specified cultivar-dependent critical value, however, it does not develop flowers. This study investigated the effects of low-intensity supplementary or night interrupting (NI) blue (B) light on the plant performance and flower induction in kalanchoe 'Rudak'. During the photoperiod in a closed-type plant factory with day/night temperatures of 23 degrees C/18 degrees C, white (W) LEDs were utilized to produce a photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) of 300 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), and B LEDs were used to give supplementary/NI light at a PPFD of 10 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). The control plants were exposed to a 10-h short day (SD, positive control) or a 13-h long day (LD, negative control) treatment without any B light. The B light was used for 4 h either (1) to supplement the W LEDs at the end of the SD (SD + 4B) and LD (LD + 4B), or (2) to provide night interruption (NI) in the SD (SD + NI-4B) and LD (LD + NI-4B). The LD + 4B and LD + NI-4B significantly enhanced plant growth and development, followed by the SD + 4B and SD + NI-4B treatments. In addition, the photosynthesis, physiological parameters, and activity of antioxidant systems were improved in those treatments. Except in the LD and LD + NI-4B, all plants flowered. It is noteworthy that kalanchoe 'Rudak' flowered in the LD + 4B treatment and induced the greatest number of flowers, followed by SD + NI-4B and SD + 4B. Plants grown in the LD + 4B treatment had the highest expression levels of certain monitored genes related to flowering. The results indicate that a 4-h supplementation of B light during the photoperiod in both the SD and LD treatments increased flower bud formation, promoted flowering, and enhanced plant performance. Kalanchoe 'Rudak' flowered especially well in the LD + 4B, presenting a possibility of practically inducing flowering in long-day seasons with B light application.

AB  - The plant factory with artificial light (PFAL) is a novel cultivation system of agriculture technology for crop production under controlled-environment conditions. However, there are a number of issues relating to low quality of seed germination and seedling vigor that lead to decreased crop yields. The present study investigates the optimal KNO3 concentration for seed germination, and the influence of different light spectra on early plant growth in holy basil (Ocimum tenuiflorum) under a PFAL system. Experiment 1 investigated the effects of KNO3 concentration (0, 0.2, 0.4 and 0.6%) on germination of seeds primed for 24 h under white Light emitting diodes (LED). Results show that sowing holy basil seeds in 0.4% KNO3 enhanced seed germination percentage (GP) and germination index (GI), while decreasing mean germination time (MGT). Experiment 2 investigated the effect of four light spectra on seed germination and early plant growth by sowing with 0 and 0.4% KNO3 and germinating for 15 days continuously under different monochromatic light settings: white, red, green and blue in PFAL. It was found that the green spectrum positively affected shoot and root length, and also decreased shortened MGT at 0 and 0.4% KNO3 when compared with other light treatments. Additionally, pre-cultivated seedlings under the green spectrum showed significant improvement in the early plant growth for all holy basil varieties at 15 days after transplanting by promoting stem length, stem diameter, plant width, fresh weights of shoot and root, and dry weights of shoot and root. These findings could be useful in developing seed priming and light treatments to enhance seed germination and seedling quality of holy basil resulting in increased crop production under PFAL.

AB  - To investigate the effects of extended light/dark (L/D) cycle period (relative to the diurnal L/D cycle) on lettuce and explore potential advantages of abnormal L/D cycles, butter leaf lettuce were grown in a plant factory with artificial light (PFAL) and exposed to mixed red (R) and blue (B) LED light with different L/D cycles that were respectively 16 h light/8 h dark (L16/D8, as control), L24/D12, L48/D24, L96/D48 and L120/D60. The results showed that, all the abnormal L/D cycles increased shoot dry weight (DW) of lettuce (by 34-83%) compared with the control, and lettuce DW increased with the L/D cycle period prolonged. The contents of soluble sugar and crude fiber in lettuce showed an overall upward trend with the length of L/D cycle extended, and the highest vitamin C content as well as low nitrate content were both detected in lettuce treated with L120/D60. The light use efficiency (LUE) and electric use efficiency (EUE) of lettuce reached the maximum (respectively 5.37% and 1.76%) under L120/D60 treatment and so were DW, Assimilation rate (A), RC/CS, ABS/CS, TRo/CS and DIo/CS, indicating that longer L/D cycle period was beneficial for the assimilation efficiency and dry matter accumulation in lettuce leaves. The highest shoot fresh weight (FW) and nitrate content detected in lettuce subjected to L24/D12 may be related to the vigorous growth of root, specific L/D cycle seemed to strengthen root growth and water absorption of lettuce. The openness level of RC in PSII (psi(o)), ETo/CS, and PIabs were all the highest in lettuce treated with L24/D12, implying that slightly extending the L/D cycle period might promote the energy flowing to the final electron transfer chain. In general, irradiation modes with extended L/D cycle period had the potential to improve energy use efficiency and biomass of lettuce in PFAL. No obvious stress or injury was detected in lettuce subjected to prolonged L/D cycles in terms of plant growth and production. From the perspective of shoot FW, the optimal treatment in this study was L24/D12, while L120/D60 was the recommended treatment as regards of the energy use efficiency and nutritional quality.

AB  - This paper presents whether some minerals in waste concrete and ferronickel slag are available for hydroponics instead of commercial fertilizer. Waste concrete and ferronickel slag contain rich calcium, silica, and magnesium, which are well-known nutrients for plants. In this study, small-scaled hydroponic plant growth tests targeting romaine lettuce and spinach were conducted to verify this idea. The experimental conditions were designed to satisfy that the total amounts of minerals released from the wastes were more than the required amounts for growth of the vegetable plants. The released amounts of minerals were evaluated from the serial batch leaching test using the wastes, then the required amounts for growth were estimated by measuring mineral contents of plants sold in supermarkets. According to the experimental results, the calcium in waste concrete was effective for growth of the romaine lettuces. The magnesium in ferronickel slag improved not only the growth of the spinaches due to photosynthesis but also the uptake amount of the phosphorous, resulting in the reduction of operating costs, such as lighting electric power and nutritional resources for plant factories. Finally, the romaine lettuces and spinaches obtained from the experiments had little contents of toxic heavy metals.

AB  - Plant breeders, scientists, and commercial producers commonly use growth rate as an integrated signal of crop productivity and stress. Plant growth monitoring is often done destructively via growth rate estimation by harvesting plants at different growth stages and simply weighing each individual plant. Within plant breeding and research applications, and more recently in commercial applications, non-destructive growth monitoring is done using computer vision to segment plants in images from the background, either in 2D or 3D, and relating these image-based features to destructive biomass measurements. Recent advancements in machine learning have improved image-based localization and detection of plants, but such techniques are not well suited to make biomass predictions when there is significant self-occlusion or occlusion from neighboring plants, such as those encountered under leafy green production in controlled environment agriculture. To enable prediction of plant biomass under occluded growing conditions, we develop an end-to-end deep learning approach that directly predicts lettuce plant biomass from color and depth image data as provided by a low cost and commercially available sensor. We test the performance of the proposed deep neural network for lettuce production, observing a mean prediction error of 7.3% on a comprehensive test dataset of 864 individuals and substantially outperforming previous work on plant biomass estimation. The modeling approach is robust to the busy and occluded scenes often found in commercial leafy green production and requires only measured mass values for training. We then demonstrate that this level of prediction accuracy allows for rapid, non-destructive detection of changes in biomass accumulation due to experimentally induced stress induction in as little as 2 days. Using this method growers may observe and react to changes in plant-environment interactions in near real time. Moreover, we expect that such a sensitive technique for non-destructive biomass estimation will enable novel research and breeding of improved productivity and yield in response to stress.

AB  - Fluorescence imaging has shown great potential in non-invasive plant monitoring and analysis. However, current systems have several limitations, such as bulky size, high cost, contact measurement, and lack of multifunctionality, which may hinder its applications in a wide range of settings including indoor vertical farming. Herein, we developed a compact handheld fluorescence imager enabling multipurpose plant phenotyping, such as continuous photosynthetic activity monitoring and non-destructive anthocyanin quantification. The compact imager comprises of pulse-amplitude-modulated multi-color light emitting diodes (LEDs), optimized light illumination and collection, dedicated driver circuit board, miniaturized charge-coupled device camera, and associated image analytics. Experiments conducted in drought stressed lettuce proved that the novel imager could quantitatively evaluate the plant stress by the non-invasive measurement of photosynthetic activity efficiency. Moreover, a non-invasive and fast quantification of anthocyanins in green and red Batavia lettuce leaves had excellent correlation (>84%) with conventional destructive biochemical analysis. Preliminary experimental results emphasize the high throughput monitoring capability and multifunctionality of our novel handheld fluorescence imager, indicating its tremendous potential in modern agriculture.

AB  - Blue light, measuring from 400 to 500 nm, is generally assumed to increase the content of antioxidants in plants independent of the species. Blue light stimulates the biosynthesis of phenolic compounds such as flavonoids and their subclass anthocyanins from the phenylpropanoid pathway. Flavonoids, anthocyanins, and phenolic acids are strong reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavengers and may lessen the symptoms of abiotic stresses such as chilling. We tested the hypothesis that a high percentage of blue light induces the accumulation of antioxidants and that this effect depends on the photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD, 400-700 nm). The effect may be more pronounced at a lower PPFD. We investigated the changes in primary and secondary metabolites of basil in response to the percentage of blue light (9, 33, 65, and 100%) applied either as a 5-day End-Of-Production (EOP) treatment or continuous throughout the growth cycle in the green cv. Dolly. We also studied if the response to the percentage of blue light (9 or 90%) was dependent on the total PPFD (100 or 300 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) PPFD) when applied as a 5-day EOP treatment in the green cv. Dolly and the purple cv. Rosie. For both green and purple basil, it was found that the percentage of blue light had little effect on the levels of antioxidants (rosmarinic acid, total ascorbic acid, total flavonoids, and total anthocyanins) at harvest and no interactive effect with PPFD was found. Antioxidants generally decreased during postharvest storage, wherein the decrease was more pronounced at 4 than at 12 degrees C. Chilling injury, as judged from a decrease in F-v/F-m values and from the occurrence of black necrotic areas, was not affected by the percentage of blue light. Particularly, chilling tolerance in the purple cultivar was increased in plants grown under higher PPFD. This may be related to the increased levels of soluble sugar and starch in leaves from high PPFD treated plants.

AB  - World-wide, sustainable crop production is increasingly dependent on the protection of crops from adverse local climate conditions by using controlled environment agriculture (CEA) facilities. Today's greenhouses and plant factories are becoming very technologically advanced. Important breakthroughs in our understanding of the deployment of affordable artificial lighting systems that can supplement and even replace solar radiation is the subject of this perspective article. The key to improving sustainable CEA is to synchronize those environmental cues that best entrain the natural circadian rhythm of the crop. Patterns of circadian rhythms reflect the balance of daily metabolic cycles and phenological stages of development that integrate and anticipate environmental changes for all complex organisms. Within the last decade, our understanding of the use of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) as spectrally tunable tools for stimulating plant responses has expanded rapidly. This perspective proposes that extending the photoperiod in CEA is an economically sustainable goal to for year-round productivity of tomato, using dynamic LED shifts that entrain the circadian rhythm. When the photoperiod is extended too far, tomato experiences injury. To avoid yield reduction, we look to nature for clues, and how circadian rhythms evolved in general to long-photoperiods during the summer in high-latitudes. It follows that circadian rhythm traits are good targets for breeders to select new tomato cultivars suitable for CEA. Circadian rhythm entrainment, using dynamic LED cues, can be tailored to any latitude-of-origin crop, and thus expands the strategies ensuring sustainable food security including healthy diets locally in any region of the world.

AB  - Y Numerous compact tomato cultivars are available for home gardening. However, evaluations under different environmental conditions are limited. The aim of this study was to characterize the growth and productivity of 20 compact tomato cultivars grown indoors under environmental conditions that resembled a residential space (11 mol.m(-2).d(-1) of white light, constant 22 degrees C, and moderate relative humidity) or in a greenhouse with sunlight only. Plants in the greenhouse were generally larger and yielded more fruit than those grown indoors, likely due to the various differences in environmental conditions and corresponding effects of water and nutrient availability. Considering growth and yield variables, all cultivars evaluated in this study are recommended for outdoor gardening. However, 'Little Bing', 'Sweet Sturdy (TM) F1-Grace', 'Sweet Sturdy (TM) F1-Jimmy', 'Sweet Sturdy (TM) F1-Jo', and 'Tarzan F10 are likely too large to be grown in most space-limited indoor environments. Furthermore, 'Little Bing', 'Rosy Finch', 'Sweet 'n' Neat Yellow', and 'Yellow Canary' were affected by intumescence when grown indoors, which could negatively affect gardening experiences until recommendations to mitigate this disorder become available. Results from this study provide baseline information for the use of compact tomato cultivars for container gardening indoors and under sunlight.

AB  - The content of secondary metabolites in medicinal plants is affected by several internal and external stimuli. Light quality is regarded as one of the considerable environmental factors affecting plant photomorphogenesis processes and bio-active compounds biosynthesis. There is a great demand for high-quality medicinal plants and plant factory systems would be helpful in response to this demand. But, before using these systems, the light spectrum required for each species must be determined. So, in this study the Hypericum perforatum L. cv. Topas plantlets were subjected to six red (R) to blue (B) light ratio treatments including 100 R:0B, 80 R:20B, 50 R:50B, 20 R:80B, 0 R:100B, and white LED was considered as control. Among the six various light treatments, plants grown under 100% red LED showed the highest fresh and dry weight of flowers, foliage and roots. The total shoot number, flowering shoot number, and flower number were significantly (P < 0.05) affected by red light spectrum, while the blue light LED and especially monochromatic blue light resulted in growth retardation. The blue light spectrum promoted the proline concentration and oxidative stress markers such as H2O2 and MDA, whereas soluble sugars concentration was higher in plants under red LED light. The highest percentage of hypericin (4.42%/m2), pseudohypericin (8.07%/m2), and hyperforin (50.67%/m2) were detected in flowers under red light treatment, calculated based on square meter. Total phytochrome was higher in the leaves of plants under R50: B50 LED and 100 R:0B treatments. Expression of the photoreceptor and flowering-related genes HpPHYA, CRY1, CRY2, GI, CO and FTL, were affected in plants under sole red light. Molecular studies have shown that red light has a flowering-enhancing effect, in contrast, blue light has a deterrent effect on H. perforatum flowering. This corroborates that red light can promote H. perforatum growth and flowering by inducing morphological, physiological and molecular responses.

AB  - There are interspecies differences in lettuce CL tolerance to LED red and blue light. It is important to clarify the response mechanism of tolerant and sensitive lettuce to CL to achieve efficient application of CL in artificial light plant factories. In the experiment, red-blue LEDs were used to provide a conventional light (360 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1), red:blue ratio 4:1 and 18/6 h photoperiod) and three continuous light (CL) treatments with various red:blue ratios (270 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1), red:blue ratio 4:1, 2:1 and 1:1) for CL-sensitive and tolerant lettuce cultivars (Yidali and Zishan) with the same daily light integral. The effects of CL quality on the growth, diurnal starch and sucrose accumulation and metabolism of two lettuces were studied by sampling at 6:00, 12:00, 18:00 and 24:00 on the 12 days after light treatment. The results showed that red-blue CL up-regulated shoot biomass of two cultivars, which might be attributed to root and leafy morphology, and chlorophyll content responses. CL with the 80% red light produced the greatest yield, but minor and medium leafy injury was found only on Yidali. CL improved starch and sucrose contents diurnally in two lettuce cultivars, and they totally decreased with blue light proportion. Sucrose synthase (SS), sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS), acid invertase (AI), neutral invertase (NI), adenosine diphosphate glucose pyrophosphorylas (AGP), alpha-amylase and 0-amylase activities under CL were improved in two lettuces compared with the conventional light. Starch and sucrose contents and SS, SPS and AGP activities basically decreased with blue light proportion for two cultivars, while AI, NI, alpha-amylase and 0-amylase activities increased inversely totally. CL irrespectively of its quality disordered the circadian rhythms of carbohydrate accumulation and metabolic enzyme activities in two lettuces. Starch content related closely positively with AGP, alpha-amylase and beta-amylase activities for Zishan, but positively AGP and beta-amylase activities for Yidali. Sucrose content correlated negatively with AI and NI activities for Zishan, while positively SS and SPS activities for Yidali. To sum up, red-blue CL with low-dose blue light could improve Yidali and Zishan lettuce yield, starch and sucrose accumulation, and metabolic enzyme activity, but CL disordered the circadian rhythms of carbohydrate accumulation and metabolic enzyme activity irrespectively of spectral quality. Yidali and Zishan lettuces are sensitive and tolerant cultivars to red-blue CL, which is not up to their abilities to maintain circadian rhythms of carbohydrate accumulation and metabolism. Furthermore, starch accumulation in two cultivars was controlled jointly by synthesis and decomposition enzymes, but sucrose accumulation in Yidali lettuce depended on decomposition enzymes rather than synthesis enzyme for purple lettuce.

AB  - Urbanisation and related insufficiency of food sources is due to the high urban population, insufficient urban food sources, and inability of some urban communities to afford food due to rising costs. Food supply can also be jeopardised by natural and man-made disasters, such as warfare, pandemics, or any other calamities which result in the destruction of crop fields and disruption of food distribution. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed the impact of such calamities on the fresh food supply chain in Malaysia, especially when the Movement Control Order (MCO) policy was first implemented. The resulting panic buying caused some food shortage, while more importantly, the fresh food supply chain was severely disrupted, especially in urban areas, in the early stages of implementation. In this regard, urban farming, while a simple concept, can have a significant impact in terms of securing food sources for urban households. It has been used in several countries such as Canada, The Netherlands, and Singapore to ensure a continuous food supply. This paper thus attempted to review how the pandemic has affected Malaysian participation in urban farming and, in relation to that, the acceptance of urban farming in Malaysia and the initiatives and approaches of local governmental and non-governmental organisations in encouraging the urban community to participate in urban farming through peer-reviewed journal articles and other articles related to urban agriculture using the ROSES protocol. About 93 articles were selected after screening to ensure that the articles were related to the study. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the surge in Malaysians' awareness of the importance of urban farming has offered great opportunities for the government to encourage more Malaysian urban communities to participate in urban farming activities. Limitations such as relevant knowledge, area, and space, however, are impediments to urban communities' participation in these activities. Government initiatives, such as the Urban Community Garden Policy (Dasar Kebun Komuniti Bandar (DKKB)), are still inadequate as some issues are still not addressed. Permanent Food Production Parks (TKPM) and technology-driven practices are seen as possible solutions to the primary problem of land and space. Additionally, relevant stakeholders play a crucial role in disseminating relevant and appropriate knowledge and methodology applicable for urban farming. Partnerships between government agencies, the education sector, and the private sector are necessary to develop modern urban agricultural technologies as well as knowledge, knowhow, and supports to build and sustain urban community participation in urban farming activities.

AB  - Duckweeds can be potentially used in human and animal nutrition, biotechnology or wastewater treatment. To cultivate large quantities of a defined product quality, a standardized production process is needed. A small-scale, re-circulating indoor vertical farm (IVF) with artificial lighting and a nutrient control and dosing system was used for this purpose. The influence of different light intensities (50, 100 and 150 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) and spectral distributions (red/blue ratios: 70/30, 50/50 and 30/70%) on relative growth rate (RGR), crude protein content (CPC), relative protein yield (RPY) and chlorophyll a of the duckweed species Lemna minor and Wolffiella hyalina were investigated. Increasing light intensity increased RGR (by 67% and 76%) and RPY (by 50% and 89%) and decreased chlorophyll a (by 27% and 32%) for L. minor and W. hyalina, respectively. The spectral distributions had no significant impact on any investigated parameter. Wolffiella hyalina achieved higher values in all investigated parameters compared to L. minor. This investigation proved the successful cultivation of duckweed in a small-scale, re-circulating IVF with artificial lighting.

AB  - Recently, there has been a surge of interest in sustainable agriculture to address the impact of urban paradigm shifts on food demand and supply. Vertical Farming (VF) has attracted considerable attention, both scholarly and economically, as a way forward to improve food security in urban areas. Previous studies have documented and reviewed the benefits of VF against traditional agriculture. However, most research papers have only focused on case studies from temperate climate regions. There is a surprising paucity of empirical research in urban farming specifically related to VF in tropical countries. This study set out to examine the new emerging agricultural innovation-VF-in various building typologies the growing system and explores the feasibility in Malaysian high-rise buildings. The findings also revealed several successful outcomes of ongoing urban farming projects in Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand, which can significantly contribute to the planning and development of VF in a tropical climate. As a result, critical assessment criteria were identified for the successful development of the VF system in urban areas. This study implies significant opportunities for Malaysia to implement VF in local high-rise buildings.

AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the efficiency of balloon flower sprout's saponin production in a plant factory with artificial lighting (PFAL). Balloon flower has been traditionally used as herbal medicine and now, it is used as a medicinal plant as well as a functional food. It is important to establish the cultivation conditions for the stable production of high-quality balloon flower. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of culture systems and temperature conditions on the growth and saponin accumulation of balloon flower sprouts in controlled environment systems. One-year balloon flower roots were cultivated in soil and soilless culture systems at different temperature conditions (20, 25, and 30 degrees C) for 17 days. The results showed that the shoot fresh weight and shoot dry weight of the balloon flower sprouts grown in the soilless culture system at 25 degrees C were significantly increased by about 1.29 and 1.58 times, respectively, as compared with those of the sprouts grown in a soil culture system. Sprouts grown in the soilless culture system at 25 degrees C also recorded the highest root fresh weight, whereas there was no significant difference in root dry weight among the treatments. The plant height results showed an increased trend similar to that of the shoot fresh weight and shoot dry weight of the balloon flower sprouts. The concentrations of platycodin D3 (Pd-D3), polygalcin D (Pc-D), and total saponin in the shoot parts were highest in the soilless culture system at 20 and 25 degrees C. The root parts of sprouts grown in the soilless culture system at 30 degrees C also had higher deapioplatycodin D (Dpd-D) and total saponin concentrations. Overall, these results suggest that a soilless culture system with temperature conditions at 20 and 25 degrees C is suitable for improving the growth and saponin concentration of balloon flower cultivated in PFALs. Ultimately, our research should be a valuable resource for future research on the production of medicinal plants such as sprouts and should provide basic information to establish methods for enhancing the growth and bioactive compounds in balloon flower.

AB  - (1) Background: We studied how the generation position of air anions in a closed-type plant factory affects the growth characteristics of lettuce and identified the optimal position. (2) Methods: We used LEDs (red/green/blue = 8:1:1) as a light source and set the temperature and RH of the plant factory to 20 +/- 2 degrees C and 50% +/- 5%, respectively. We grew lettuce under three air anion conditions-sideward, upward, and downward-and compared the growth characteristics to those of a control grown without air anions. We measured the growth characteristics of the lettuce at 3 and 4 weeks after sowing, and the measurement items were shoot fresh weight (FW) and dry weight (DW); leaf area (LA), length (LL), and width (LW); SPAD; antioxidant capacity; and total phenol content. (3) Results: At 4 weeks, FW in the downward treatment condition was 25.3% higher than in the control, and DW showed a similar difference. LA was about 1943.94 cm(2)/plant in the downward treatment condition, which was about 15.5% higher than in the control. (4) Conclusions: We conclude that air anion generation has a positive effect on lettuce growth, and the optimal generation position for air anions is downward.

AB  - Vertical farms have expanded rapidly in urban areas to support food system resilience. However, many of these systems source a substantial share of their material and energy requirements outside their urban environments. As urban areas produce significant shares of residual material and energy streams, there is considerable potential to explore the utilization of these streams for urban agriculture in addition to the possibility of employing underutilized urban spaces in residential and commercial buildings. This study aims to explore and assess the potential for developing more circular vertical farming systems which integrate with buildings and utilize residual material and energy streams. We focus on the symbiotic development of a hypothetical urban farm located in the basement of a residential building in Stockholm. Life cycle assessment is used to quantify the environmental performance of synergies related to energy integration and circular material use. Energy-related scenarios include the integration of the farm's waste heat with the host building's heating system and the utilization of solar PV. Circular material synergies include growing media and fertilizers based on residual materials from a local brewery and biogas plant. Finally, a local pick-up system is studied to reduce transportation. The results point to large benefits from integrating the urban farm with the building energy system, reducing the vertical farm's GHG emissions up to 40%. Synergies with the brewery also result in GHG emissions reductions of roughly 20%. No significant change in the environmental impacts was found from the use of solar energy, while the local pick-up system reduces environmental impacts from logistics, although this does not substantially lower the overall environmental impacts. However, there are some trade-offs where scenarios with added infrastructure can also increase material and water resource depletion. The results from the synergies reviewed suggest that proximity and host-building synergies can improve the material and energy efficiency of urban vertical farms. The results provide insights to residential building owners on the benefits of employing residual space for urban food provisioning and knowledge to expand the use of vertical farming and circular economy principles in an urban context.

AB  - Background Productivities of bioactive compounds in high-value herbs and medicinal plants are often compromised by uncontrollable environmental parameters. Recent advances in the development of plant factories with artificial lighting (PFAL) have led to improved qualitative and/or quantitative production of bioactive compounds in several medicinal plants. However, information concerning the effect of light qualities on plant pharmaceutical properties is limited. The influence of three different light-emitting diode (LED) spectra on leaf fresh weight (FW), bioactive compound production and bioactivity of Artemisia annua L. against the malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum NF54 was investigated. Correlation between the A. annua metabolites and antimalarial activity of light-treated plant extracts were also determined. Results Artemisia annua plants grown under white and blue spectra that intersected at 445 nm exhibited higher leaf FW and increased amounts of artemisinin and artemisinic acid, with enhanced production of several terpenoids displaying a variety of pharmacological activities. Conversely, the red spectrum led to diminished production of bioactive compounds and a distinct metabolite profile compared with other wavelengths. Crude extracts obtained from white and blue spectral treatments exhibited 2 times higher anti-Plasmodium falciparum activity than those subjected to the red treatment. Highest bioactivity was 4 times greater than those obtained from greenhouse-grown plants. Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) revealed a strong correlation between levels of several terpenoids and antimalarial activity, suggesting that these compounds might be involved in increasing antimalarial activity. Conclusions Results demonstrated a strategy to overcome the limitation of A. annua cultivation in Bangkok, Thailand. A specific LED spectrum that operated in a PFAL system promoted the accumulation of some useful phytochemicals in A. annua, leading to increased antimalarial activity. Therefore, the application of PFAL with appropriate light spectra showed promise as an alternative method for industrial production of A. annua or other useful medicinal plants with minimal environmental influence.

AB  - The responses of yield, nutritional quality and antioxidant capacity of hydroponic purple-lettuce were investigated in a plant factory to different alternations of temporally overlapped red (R) and blue (B) light under continuous irradiation in which spectral photon flux density distribution changed with various combinations of R and B LEDs on a 24-h cycle. Two constant simultaneous rend and bleu (R-B) light treatments including one normal photoperiod (RB, 16/8 h, 225 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1)) and one continuous light (RB', 24/0 h, 150 mu mol.m(-2).;s(-1)) as well as three alternating temporally overlapped light treatments (B to R-B and then R, each part lasts the same time) with alternating frequencies of one time (T1), two times (T2) and four times (T4) respectively in 24 h were set up with the same daily light integral (DLI). The lettuce plants were exposed to the irradiation patterns for 14 days. In all treatments, plants received the same quantum number of red or blue light and the same daily light integral (12.96 mu mol.m(-2)). In comparison with normal photoperiod (RB), the results showed that lettuce plants gained greater shoot fresh and dry weight under RB' and T1 both on the 7 and 14 days after treatment, which depended on leaf area and biomass allocation. Among alternating light treatments, the shoot fresh weight of lettuce decreased with the increase of alternating frequencies. Lettuce plants under alternating temporally overlapped treatments had significantly higher MDA, H2O2 and O(2-)contents as well as higher SOD and CAT activities than that under RB and RB'. Alternating light treatments also induced phenols accumulation, and particularly lettuce under T2 had significantly higher anthocyanin, flavonoid and total phenol contents than RB. However, prolongation of light period under the same DLI condition might promote nitrate accumulation in lettuce while had no positive effects on starch and soluble sugar contents. Therefore, alternating temporally overlapped red and blue light under continuous irradiation could improve the antioxidant capacity of lettuce to a certain extent, and the responses of lettuce antioxidant system to alternating light exposure might depend on the duration and alternating frequency of two monochromatic light qualities.

AB  - This study investigates and quantifies the integrative effects of CO2 concentration (500, 1000 and 1500 mu mol mol(-1)), illumination intensity (100, 200 and 300 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) and air speed (0.25, 0.50 and 0.75 m s(-1)) on the growth, gas exchange and light use efficiency of lettuce plants (Lactuca sativa L.) grown under artificial lighting. The results show that lettuce growth and gas exchange are closely related to CO2 concentration and illumination intensity, while air speed enhances CO2 transport during photosynthesis. The most influential two-way interactions were observed between CO2 concentration and illumination intensity on the fresh and dry weights of lettuce shoots with effect sizes of 34% and 32%, respectively, and on the photosynthesis, transpiration and light use efficiency, with effect sizes of 52%, 47% and 41%, respectively. The most significant three-way interaction was observed for the photosynthetic rate, with an effect size of 51%. In general, the fresh and dry weights of lettuce plants increased by 36.2% and 20.1%, respectively, with an increase in CO2 concentration from 500 to 1500 mu mol mol(-1) and by 48.9% and 58.6%, respectively, with an increase in illumination intensity from 100 to 300 mu mol m(-)(2) s(-1). The photosynthetic rate was found to be positively correlated with CO2 concentration, illumination intensity and air speed. The transpiration rate and stomatal conductance increased by 34.9% and 42.1%, respectively, when the illumination intensity increased from 100 to 300 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). However, as CO2 concentration increased from 500 to 1500 mu mol mol(-1) and air speed increased from 0.25 to 0.75 m s(-1), the transpiration rate decreased by 17.5% and 12.8%, respectively. With the quantified data obtained, we were able to adequately determine how CO2 concentration, illumination intensity and air speed interact with their combined effects on the growth of lettuce plants grown in indoor cultivation systems with artificial lighting.

AB  - Vertical farming is considered as a potential solution to increase yield while decreasing resource use and pesticide impacts compared to conventional agriculture. However, the profitability of cultivating ordinary leafy green crops with low market prices in vertical farming is debated. We studied the agronomic feasibility and viability of growing a medicinal plant-Euphorbia peplus-for its ingenol-mebutate content in a modified shipping container farm as an alternative crop cultivation system. The impacts of three hydroponic substrates, three light intensities, three plant localizations and two surface areas on E. peplus yield and cost were tested in several scenarios. The optimization of biomass yield and area surface decreased the cultivation cost, with fresh crop cost per kg ranging from euro185 to euro59. Three ingenol-mebutate extraction methods were tested. The best extraction yields and cheapest method can both be attributed to ethyl acetate at 120 degrees C, with a yield of 43.8 mg/kg at a cost of euro38 per mg. Modeling of the profitability of a pharmaceutical gel based on ingenol-mebutate showed that economic feasibility was difficult to reach, but some factors could rapidly increase the profitability of this production.

AB  - Hydroponic cultivation using nutrient solution (NS) is the main cultivation method employed by plant factories with artificial lighting (PFALs). The electrical conductivity (EC) of NSs influences the yield and quality of vegetables. The purpose of this study was to optimize the yield and antioxidant accumulation of basil in a PFAL by EC management. In experiment 1, basil plants were grown under four different ECs (0.5, 1.0, 3.0, and 5.0 dS m(-1)) after transplanting. At 18 days after treatment, the highest levels of shoot fresh and dry weights, leaf fresh and dry weights, and leaf area were observed at an EC of 3.0 dS m(-1). However, low-EC treatments (0.5 and 1.0 dS m(-1)) generated total phenolic content (TPC) and antioxidant capacities that were higher than those of other EC treatments (3.0 and 5.0 dS m(-1)). In experiment 2, basil plants were grown at an EC of 3.0 dS m(-1) for 13 or 15 days, then treated with water or NS with low ECs (0.5 and 1.0 dS m(-1)) for 5 or 3 days before harvest. The short-term low-EC treatments, especially, water for 3 days and 0.5 dS m(-1) for 5 days, significantly increased the TPC and antioxidant capacity of leaves without significantly decreasing the yields of basil, compared with the control. In conclusion, yield of basil was optimized with an EC of 3.0 dS m(-1); however, the TPC and antioxidant capacity of basil were significantly increased by low ECs of 0.5 and 1.0 dS m(-1). Short-term low-EC treatments (0.5 dS m(-1) for 5 days or water for 3 days) could be used to promote the TPC and antioxidant capacity in leaves without sacrificing yield of basil significantly.

AB  - Much emphasis is now being placed on the research and development of fully closed and controlled plant factories aimed at supplying fresh vegetables safely and constantly. Plant factories produce large volumes of clean and safe vegetables in an artificially controlled environment. One of the important issues in the management and control of plant factories is establishing systematic methods for planning the production and shipping of daily produced vegetables to various customers, such as supermarkets, vegetable shops, and restaurants. Customer demand is influenced by the sales in the individual shops and trade volumes, and prices in the wholesale markets of the vegetables, since the share of the plant factory-made vegetables is very small. Systematic methods are required for the management and control of plant factories to forecast both orders from individual customers and wholesale market conditions. In the previous study, the market situations and the trading processes of the factory-made lettuces were investigated, and a market model was proposed to simulate the trading processes between the customers and the plant factories. This study deals with demand forecasting of wholesale markets for vegetables, aimed at taking into consideration the wholesale market conditions for production planning in plant factories.

AB  - During recent decades, there has been increasing awareness of the development of "agritecture" ("agri"culture + archi"tecture") as a means to transform and revolutionize the food supply of future cities. The different forms of agritecture include building-integrated agricultural concepts such as vertical farms or indoor farms. In this way, urban food production could take place in proximity to consumers while employing so-called "urban waste" products (such as wastewater, waste heat, and organic waste) as valuable production inputs. Although scholars frequently highlight the potential of vertical farming and other agritecture approaches for Asian megacities, there is still a lack of academic research and completed projects related to this field in China. This study uses a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative and qualitative research in the study location of Shanghai, to reveal the social acceptance of indoor agritecture among consumers and experts. First, to explore the perceptions of consumers, a survey of 713 potential consumers was conducted in Shanghai. Second, these surveys were complemented by 20 expert interviews with academics and practitioners from Shanghai to frame the quantitative research results. Our results revealed that the surveyed consumers' social acceptance of indoor agritecture and the expectations of the experts are high. Additionally, there is already a high level of demand and a potential market for indoor agritecture in Shanghai. This has been confirmed by the ongoing construction of the first moderate-scale vertical farm and several indoor farms, in combination with the increasing existence of edible landscape approaches and rooftop farms. This development can be viewed as the rise of urban agritecture in Shanghai. The interviews revealed that experts raise more doubts about the economic dimension, whereas its social and ecological dimensions and the contextual framework of indoor agritecture are considered to be positive.

AB  - Greenhouses and vertical farming enable food production in cities, but their energy and energy-related land demands may affect their overall sustainability in specific regions. Through geospatial and mathematical modelling, this study compares open-field and two indoor farming methods for vegetable production in nine city-regions around the world.
   Modern greenhouses and vertical farming projects promise increased food output per unit area relative to open-field farming. However, their high energy consumption calls for a low-carbon power supply such as solar photovoltaic and wind, which adds to cost and overall land footprint. Here we use geospatial and mathematical modelling to compare open-field and two indoor farming methods for vegetable production in nine city-regions chosen globally with varying land availability, climatic conditions and population density. We find that renewable electricity supply is more costly for greenhouses per unit energy demand satisfied, which is due to the greater fluctuation in their energy demand profile. However, greenhouses have a lower energy demand per unit food output, which makes them the least land-intensive option in most of the analysed regions. Our results challenge the land-savings claims of vertical farming compared with open-field production. We also show that regionalizing vegetable supply is feasible in most regions and give recommendations based on the regional context.

AB  - Recently, there has been considerable interest in establishing tree-rearing methods for breeding nursery trees, which are similar to the methods employed in plant factories to produce vegetables. Studies have shown that the efficiency of tree cultivation can be improved by changing the wavelength of the lighting that is used to raise young plants and that light emitting diodes (LEDs) are effective for this purpose. In this study, the effect of blue (450 nm), red (660 nm), and white (combination of blue and yellow (525 nm) LED lights was investigated for rearing Cryptomeria japonica saplings. 7 saplings with each LED were prepared and reared for 52 weeks in a constant environment chamber (Temperature: 23 +/- 2 degrees C, relative humidity 50% +/- 10%), and their growth rates and root system morphology were compared. After 52 weeks of breeding, red light induced slightly more stem growth than white light. Blue light was nearly three times more effective in stem growth than white light. Furthermore, the wavelength of light affected the root system morphology. Many root branches were observed in saplings reared under red light, while marked taproot growth was observed in saplings reared under blue light. There was a possibility that saplings could be produced more efficiently by using LED.

AB  - The most recent platform for protected horticultural crop production, with the shortest history to date, is located entirely indoors, lacking even the benefit of free, natural sunlight. Although this may not sound offhand like a good idea for commercial specialty-crop production, the concept of indoor controlled-environment plant growth started originally for the benefit of researchers-to systematically investigate effects of specific environmental factors on plant growth and development in isolation from environmental factors varying in uncontrolled ways that would confound or change experimental findings. In addition to its value for basic and applied research, it soon was discovered that providing nonlimiting plant-growth environments greatly enhanced crop yield and enabled manipulation of plant development in ways that were never previously possible. As supporting technology for indoor crop production has improved in capability and efficiency, energy requirements have declined substantially for growing crops through entire production cycles in completely controlled environments, and this combination has spawned a new sector of the controlled-environment crop-production industry. This article chronicles the evolution of events, enabling technologies, and entrepreneurial efforts that have brought local, year-round indoor crop production to the forefront of public visibility and the threshold of profitability for a growing number of specialty crops in locations with seasonal climates.

AB  - This paper outlines a method for determining the maximum number of floors of a vertical farm (VF) that can be powered by building-integrated solar photovoltaic panels for supplying artificial lighting to the plants. The panels are mounted on all the walls and the rooftop of the building. It takes into account the location of the site, the monthly average daily solar irradiation, parameters associated with the luminaires, the geometrical dimensions and orientation of the layout, the tilt angle and row spacing between the rooftop panels, and the efficiency of the conversion system. It then provides linear equations representing the year-round electricity demand of the luminaires and the yearly electric yield from the panels. These equations are solved simultaneously to estimate the maximum number of floors. The results show that design performance can be maximized by optimizing the floor dimensions, layout orientation, tilt angle, and row spacing. Hypothetical 300 m(2) vertical farms, partially occupied by growing trays, located in Auckland and Dubai, were found to have maximum heights of 1.87 and 3.47 floors, respectively. A free online tool is also presented to help designers and researchers analyze designs located anywhere in the world.

AB  - With the recent development of LED lighting systems for plant cultivation, the use of vertical farming under controlled conditions is attracting increased attention. This study investigated the impact of a number of LED light spectra (red, blue, green and white) on the growth, development and essential oil content of lemon balm (Melissa officinalis), a herb and pharmaceutical plant species used across the world. White light and red-rich light spectra gave the best outputs in terms of impact on the growth and yield. For blue-rich spectra, the development and yield was lower despite having a significant impact on the photosynthesis activity, including Fv/Fm and NDVI values. For the blue-rich spectra, a peak wavelength of 450 mn was better than that of 435 nm. The results have practical value in terms of increased yield and the reduction of electricity consumption under controlled environmental conditions for the commercial production of lemon balm.

AB  - Light and temperature are related to the growth and development of plants as well as their energy consumption in plant factories. However, most of the studies to date have focused on light and temperature extremes, while the adaptive responses and underlying mechanisms of plants to non-stress light intensity (LI) and night temperature (NT) largely remain elusive. Here, we investigated the growth and physiological responses of tomatoes grown under three LI regimes of 250 (L-L), 300 (L-M), and 350 (L-H) mu mol m(-2) s(-1), respectively, combined with two NT conditions. The results revealed that increased LI comprehensively improved tomato growth and physiological status at lower NT levels, but the growth stimulations induced by increasing LI were limited by higher NT. In addition, the lower NT at L-M and L-H conferred a relatively better endogenous physiological condition and significantly promoted tomato growth, but the higher NT significantly accelerated shoot growth at L-L, indicating a compensation of higher NT for low light induced growth restriction. Taken together, the current study suggests that the adaptation mechanism of tomato plants to higher NT varied with LI levels, and higher LI plus lower NT would be an effective strategy to improve tomato growth.

AB  - The optimization of plant-specific LED lighting protocols for indoor plant growing systems needs both basic and applied research. Experiments with lettuce, Lactuca sativa L., plants using artificial lighting based on narrow-band LEDs were carried out in a controlled environment. We investigated plant responses to the exclusion of certain spectral ranges of light in the region of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR); in comparison, the responses to quasimonochromatic radiation in the red and blue regions were studied separately. The data on plant phenotyping, photosynthetic activity determination, and PAM fluorometry, indicating plant functional activity and stress responses to anomalous light environments, are presented. The study on carbon isotopic composition of photoassimilates in the diel cycle made it possible to characterize the balance of carboxylation and photorespiration processes in the leaves, using a previously developed oscillatory model of photosynthesis. Thus, the share of plant photorespiration (related to plant biomass enrichment with C-13) increased in response to red-light action, while blue light accelerated carboxylation (related to C-12 enrichment). Blue light also reduced water use efficiency. These data are supported by the observations from the light environments missing distinct PAR spectrum regions. The fact that light of different wavelengths affects the isotopic composition of total carbon allowed us to elucidate the nature of its action on the organization of plant metabolism.

AB  - As one of the important products of modern agricultural development, plant factories can provide a suitable environment for the growth and development of crops. Intelligently detecting the survival rate of crops in multiple key growth stages can not only improve the space utilization of plant factory, but also help increase crop yields. In this work, our main task is to use a novel method to detect the survival rate of rape seedlings at multiple growth stages in the plant factory. First of all, for the key growth stages where seedlings may die, we obtained image datasets of the whole process of seed germination, the early, and the middle stage of seedling transplanting. Second, we used the state-of-the-art method YOLO-V5s to construct the target detection model for the rape seedling dataset of the three key growth stages, and achieved good performance of the model mAP@0.5 as 0.994, 0.996, and 0.996 respectively. Finally, in order to construct a model suitable for the detection of the survival rate of rape in multiple key growth stages, we propose a new method called ESPA-YOLO-V5s, and achieved a good model performance with a mAP@0.5 of 0.996. The experimental results prove that our method has laid a good foundation for the survival rate detection of the key growth stages of plant.

AB  - Heat and moisture transfer have a substantial influence on plant photosynthesis and productivity. Therefore, this study investigated the combined effect of light intensity (100, 200, and 300 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) and air velocity (0.25, 0.50, and 0.75 m s(-1)) on the sensible heat flux (S-h), convection regime (CR), and latent heat flux (L-h) of lettuce plants grown in a plant factory with artificial light. The growth, photosynthetic rate, and occurrence of tipburn in lettuce plants were also evaluated. The effect of light intensity and air velocity on the thermal exchange of indoor-cultured lettuce was achieved through their combined effect on conductance to heat and mass transfer. Stomatal conductance was found to be strongly correlated with light intensity, with a correlation coefficient of 73%. The boundary layer conductance was highly correlated with air velocity, with a correlation coefficient of 96%. Accordingly, the S-h and L-h increased by 41.0% and 46.9%, respectively, with an increase in light intensity from 100 to 300 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), and by 33.2% and 30.4%, respectively, with an increase in air velocity from 0.25 to 0.75 m s(-1). Air velocity had a greater impact on CR, and forced convection was dominant between lettuce plants and the surrounding air. During the dark period, a decrease in stomatal conductance was accompanied by a decrease in L-h, particularly as air velocity increased. The photosynthetic rate and fresh weight of lettuce plants were strongly correlated with light intensity, and increased by 60.9% and 54.7%, respectively, as light intensity increased from 100 to 300 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). However, the occurrence of tipburn in lettuce plants was significantly related to light intensity, and the highest number of lettuce leaves injured with tipburn of 5 leaves/plant was observed at a light intensity of 300 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). When air velocity increased from 0.25 to 0.75 m s(-1), the occurrence of tipburn decreased by 87.3%. Our results reveal that there was an obvious interaction between light intensity and air velocity on the thermal exchange, growth, and occurrence of tipburn in indoor-cultured lettuce. This study provides valuable insights into the combinational regulation of light intensity and air velocity for improving the growth and marketability of indoor-cultured lettuce.

AB  - Ginseng (Panax ginseng C. A. Meyer) sprouts have a high content of saponins (ginsenosides) in their shoots, and their value as medicinal vegetables is increasing. However, there are no standardized cultivation guidelines for ginseng sprouts for raw foods, and the effect of light quality on growth and ginsenoside content in ginseng sprouts is not clear. The objective of this study was to analyze the growth and ginsenoside content of ginseng sprouts aeroponically grown in plant factories under supplemental far-red and ultraviolet-B (UV-B) light treatments. One-year-old ginseng seedlings were transplanted into a plant factory with a photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) of 50 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) using light-emitting diodes of red:blue = 1:1. Based on the phytochrome photostationary state value of solar radiation equal to 0.72, far-red light treatment with 18 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) for 16 h per day was applied from 0, 6, and 12 days after transplanting (DAT). For UV-B light treatments, different UV-B radiation exposure times with 0.1 W m(-2) dose were applied for 1, 2, and 3 h on the day before harvest. Under the control condition, stem hardness steeply increased after 18 DAT, making raw consumption of whole ginseng sprouts difficult. When the far-red light was applied, the electron transport rates of photosystems II and I of ginseng leaves increased and nonphotochemical quenching decreased at a high PPFD range, but no differences were found at 50 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). Far-red light treatments significantly lowered the stem hardness but did not induce significant differences in other growth factors or ginsenoside contents regardless of duration. Under additional UV-B radiation, no significant differences in photochemical characteristics or ginsenoside content were observed. As a result, additional far-red lighting can be utilized to maintain low stem hardness and extend the cultivation period.

AB  - Composting has been used extensively as a sustainable approach for the management organic waste streams and conversion into stabilized soil amendments and horticultural growth media. In addition to these products, the composting process also generates by-products of microbial metabolism that includes gas (CO2) and energy (heat). High rates of food waste and commercial organic waste generation, along with greater diversion away from landfills, creates new opportunities to valorize these by-products from aerobic composting. Specifically, integrating carbon dioxide recapture and recycling into Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA) production systems presents a pathway to circularize resources. CEA systems produce plants year round in an environmentally controlled space where elevating CO2 environments can boost plant production, creating a synergistic relationship with composting processes. The review evaluated CO2 emissions from an array of open and closed composting systems, as well as different feedstocks to demonstrate its potential for use in CEA. Rates of CO2 emissions varied widely, with a peak CO2 emission range of 0.32-429.27 g CO2-C kg(- 1) d(-1) depending on the aeration conditions and feedstock composition. Analysis of two hypothetical CEA scenarios reveals that integrating in-vessel composting as an on-site waste management process is comparable in cost to using natural gas as a regular CO2 source. The quantity of composting feedstocks required to generate CO2 emissions for a single tier and five tier CEA lettuce production system ranged from 3.38 to 69.94 kg dry biomass d(-1) and 9.93-205.50 kg dry biomass d(-1), respectively, but varied based on feedstock composition and compost operating conditions. The long-term research goal is toward valorizing non-edible biomass of CEA systems to create a circular economy model of commercial plant production.

AB  - Here, we determined the effects of mild water deficit (WD) and high CO2 concentration (HC) on the growth and bioactive compounds of dropwort and proposed culture conditions for producing high-quality plants. Plantlets with two to three offshoots were transplanted to a controlled environment room with artificial light and cultivated for 6 weeks. To investigate the effects of HC, plantlets were grown under relatively low CO2 concentration (LC; 600 mu mol mol(-1) CO2) or HC (1000 mu mol mol(-1) CO2) conditions for 6 weeks (HC6) or grown under standard conditions for 3 weeks and transferred to HC conditions for the remaining 3 weeks (HC3). To investigate the effects of WD, control plantlets were subirrigated by keeping the pots in a tray of nutrient solution, whereas WD-treated plants were allowed to absorb water through wicks extending from the pot bottoms to a nutrient solution below. Leaf water potential of WD-treated plantlets was significantly lower than that of controls. Both WD and HC significantly decreased leaf area but did not significantly affect shoot fresh and dry weights. The photosynthetic rates of HC6- and HC3-treated plantlets were 53% and 64% greater, respectively, than that of LC; the stomatal conductance and transpiration rate exhibited opposite trends. WD significantly decreased net photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate, and stomatal conductance. The total nonstructural carbohydrate content of HC6- and HC3-treated plantlets was 8% and 14% greater, respectively, than that of LC. Total phenolic content and antioxidant capacity of WD plantlets were 17% and 23% greater, respectively, than those of controls. In controls, total phenolic content of HC6- and HC3-treated plantlets was increased significantly (by 24% and 34%, respectively) than that of LC plantlets. Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) activity of WD-treated plantlets was 14% higher than that of controls; in the controls, PAL activity of HC-treated plantlets increased significantly (by 19%) compared to that of LC plantlets. However, HC did not affect PAL activity under WD. Cyanidin content was increased by both WD and HC treatments. These results indicate that reddish small dropwort (WD treated plantlets) is more useful than greenish dropwort as a functional food and can be easily produced through HC when grown in a closed environment (e.g., a greenhouse or plant factory). Finally, the cultural practice of HC can improve the industrial value of small dropwort grown for food processing.

AB  - UV-A light has different effects on the growth and bioactive compounds of vegetables, medicinal plants, and other crops. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of short-term irradiation with UV-A light-emitting diodes (LEDs) on the growth and bioactive substances of kale (Brassica oleracea var. acephala). Two-week-old kale seedlings were cultivated for 3 weeks in a plant factory illuminated with LEDs (red:white:blue = 8:1:1) of 150 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) photosynthetic photon flux density. Then, the plants were continuously exposed to five peak wavelengths (365, 375, 385, 395, and 405 nm) of UV-A LEDs with an energy of 30 W m(-2) in addition to the background lighting for 7 days. Treatments with 395 and 405 nm wavelengths increased most of the assessed growth characteristics and photosynthetic rates compared to the control after 7 days of treatment. The maximum quantum efficiency of photosystem II (Fv/Fm) value started to decrease after 1 day of treatment, and after 5 days, we detected an increase in the concentration of reactive oxygen species with a decrease in the wavelength of the UV-A light treatment. There were increases in the total phenolic and flavonoid contents and antioxidant levels of kale plants subjected to all of the UV-A LEDs compared with control plants after 7 days. Our observations indicated that phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) and chalcone synthase gene expression and PAL enzyme activity were upregulated by the UV-A LED treatments, although no significant differences among treatments were detected. Collectively, our results indicate that kale biomass and bioactive compounds can be enhanced through supplementary UV-A radiation, with 405-nm LEDs having the best effects, thereby suggesting that it would be beneficial to conduct additional research on the spectral threshold between UV-A and deep-blue light.

AB  - Inefficiencies and imprecise input control in agriculture have caused devastating consequences to ecosystems. Urban controlled environment agriculture (CEA) is a proposed approach to mitigate the impacts of cultivation, but precise control of inputs (i.e., nutrient, water, etc.) is limited by the ability to monitor dynamic conditions. Current mechanistic and physiological plant growth models (MPMs) have not yet been unified and have uncovered knowledge gaps of the complex interplay among control variables. Moreover, because of their specificity, MPMs are of limited utility when extended to additional plant species or learning (ML) can uncover latent interactions across conditions, phenotyping bottlenecks have hindered successful application. To bridge these gaps, we propose an integrative approach whereby MPMs are used to construct the foundations of ML algorithms, reducing data requirements and costs, and ML is used to elucidate parameters and causal inference in MPM. This review highlights research about control and automation in CEA, synthesizing literature into a framework whereby ML, MPM, and biofeedback inform what we call dynamically controlled environment agriculture (DCEA). We highlight synergistic characteristics of MPM and ML to illustrate that a DCEA framework could contribute to urban resilience, human health, and optimized productivity and nutritional content.

AB  - Light is a crucial signal for plant growth, development, and secondary metabolism. Exploring the effects of light on autotoxin secretion in lettuce can be helpful for improving the utilization efficiency of the nutrient solution in plant factories. The effects of white light (WL) and the combination of red (R) and blue (B) light (RB, 4R:1B) at different intensities (150, 200, and 250 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) on the growth and root exudates of hydroponic lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) were studied in a closed plant factory. The lettuce biomass and photosynthetic rate increased with the increasing light intensity, and the photosynthetic rate was significantly lower under WL than under RB at both 200 and 250 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). Lettuce under WL had the longest root length and highest root surface area at 200 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), while the root length, root surface area, and root volume under RB were the highest at 250 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). Total organic carbon (TOC) content of root exudates in the nutrient solution based on shoot or root dry weight decreased with the increasing light intensity. With the increase in light intensity, the secretion of four autotoxins (benzoic acid, ferulic acid, gallic acid, and tannic acid) based on shoot dry weight and root dry weight decreased under WL. Compared with RB, WL significantly reduced the secretion of autotoxins at 250 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). In conclusion, 250 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) white light should be used for high lettuce yield, and it could also decrease the autotoxins in the nutrient solution and the occurrence of autotoxicity.

AB  - Purpose This paper aims to explore the literature on vertical farming to define key elements to outline a business model for entrepreneurs. The research aims to stimulate entrepreneurship for vertical farming in a smart cities' context, recognising urban agriculture as technology to satisfy increasing food needs. Design/methodology/approach The research conducts a structured literature review on 186 articles on vertical farming extracted from the Scopus. Moreover, the bibliometric analysis revealed the descriptive statistics on this field and the main themes through the authors' keywords. Findings Different perspectives showed the multidisciplinary nature of the topic and how the intersection of different skills is necessary to understand the subject entirely. The keywords analysis allowed for identifying the topics covered by the authors and the business model's elements. Research limitations/implications The research explores a topic in the embryonic stage to define key strands of literature. It provides business model insights extending George and Bock's (2011) research to stimulate entrepreneurship in vertical farming. Limitations arise from the sources used to develop our analysis and how the topic appears as a frontier innovation. Originality/value Originality is the integration of literature strands related to vertical farming, highlighting its multidisciplinary nature to provide a holistic understanding of the themes. In smart cities' context, innovations allow traditional business models to be interpreted in a novel perspective and revealed the elements for transforming vertical farming from innovative technology to an effective source of food sustenance. Finally, the paper suggests a new methodology application for the analysis of word clusters by integrating correspondence analysis and multidimensional scaling analysis.

AB  - Phosphor-converted white LEDs (PCW-LEDs) of numerous types with different relative spectral photon-flux-density distributions (SPDs) are commercially available today. Some are regarded as promising light sources for use in plant factories with artificial lighting. The leaf net photosynthetic rate (P-n) measured under PCW-LED light is an important criterion for evaluating PCW-LEDs in terms of photosynthesis performance. To ascertain P-n rapidly under dozens of PCW-LED lights having different SPDs, we have developed a rapid and semi-automated P-n-quantification method. The method uses a modified LED-artificial sunlight source system (LASS system) and a P-n-measurement system. The modified LASS system can produce light with an SPD, which can accurately approximate that of any PCW-LED light at a photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) of 150 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). First, PCW-LED lights of 30 types at a PPFD of 150 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) were produced using the modified LASS system within 2.5 h. We then measured the Pn of cos lettuce, red-leaf lettuce, and green-leaf lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) plants. In a 16-h P-n measurement repetition, the modified LASS system supplied all the produced lights automatically and successively to an identical leaf of a lettuce plant. A P-n-measurement system simultaneously measured Pn under the produced light. Results show that the mean P-n values of the cos lettuce, red-leaf lettuce, and green-leaf lettuce under the 30 produced lights at 20 days after sowing were, respectively, 7.11-8.02, 5.76-7.11, and 4.83-6.17 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). A rapid and semi-automated method was developed for successive measurement of Pn under dozens of combined lights, of which each SPD approximated that of the selected PCW-LED lights, within days, which indicates that the method can determine the P-n quickly under numerous PCW-LED lights. Results show that the system contributes to rapid selection of PCW-LED lights performing high P-n.

AB  - The increase in global population, which negatively affects energy consumption, CO2 emissions, and arable land, necessitates designing sustainable habitation alternatives. Self-sufficient high-rise buildings, which integrate (electricity) generation and efficient usage of resources with dense habitation, can be a sustainable solution for future urbanisation. This paper focuses on transforming Europoint Towers in Rotterdam into self-sufficient buildings considering energy consumption and food production (lettuce crops) using artificial intelligence. Design parameters consist of the number of farming floors, shape, and the properties of the proposed facade skin that includes shading devices. Nine thousand samples are collected from various floor levels to predict self-sufficiency criteria using artificial neural networks (ANN). Optimisation problems with 117 decision variables are formulated using 45 ANN models that have very high prediction accuracies. 13 optimisation algorithms are used for an in-detail investigation of self-sufficiency at the building scale, and potential sufficiency at the neighbourhood scale. Results indicate that 100% and 43.7% self-sufficiencies could be reached for lettuce crops and electricity, respectively, for three buildings with 1800 residents. At the neighbourhood scale, lettuce production could be sufficient for 27,000 people with a decrease of self-sufficiency in terms of energy use of up to 11.6%. Consequently, this paper discusses the potentials and the improvements for self-sufficient high-rise buildings.

AB  - The greenhouse is one of the sustainable forms of smart agricultural farming. It is considered as an alternate method to overcome the food crisis which is generated due to high population growth, climate change, and environmental pollution. Although this method supports off-the-season crops within the enclosed area even in severe climatic zones. It has required to efficiently control and manage the crop parameters at a greenhouse in a more precise and secure way. The advancement of the Internet of Things (IoT) has introduced smart solutions to automate the greenhouse farming parameters such as plant monitoring, internal atmosphere control, and irrigation control. The survey presents a hierarchy on the major components of IoT-based greenhouse farming. A rigorous discussion on greenhouse farming techniques, IoT-based greenhouse categories, network technologies (cloud/edge computing, IoT protocols, data analytics, sensors) has been presented. Furthermore, a detailed discussion on mobile-based greenhouse applications and IoT applications has been presented to manage the greenhouse farm. Moreover, the success stories and statistical analysis of some agricultural countries have been presented to standardize IoT-based greenhouse farming. Lastly, the open issues and research challenges related to IoT-enabled greenhouse farming has been presented with state-of-the-art future research directions.

AB  - Changes in plant responses have been associated with different fractions of the visible spectrum and light intensity. Advances in light-emitting diodes (LED) have enabled the study of the effect of narrow wavelengths on plant growth and antioxidant compound synthesis. LED technology also facilitates the incorporation of light sources in a controlled setting where light spectra and intensity can be regulated. The objective of this study was to compare the effect of two commercial light spectra (Si: standard white light with 32.8% blue. 42.5% green, 21.7% red, and 2.4% far-red; S2: AP67 spectrum, designed for horticultural growth, with 16.9% blue, 20.5% green, 49.7% red and 12.3% far red) at two light intensities [low intensity (78 mu mol.m(-2)s(-1) of photons for Si and 62 mu mol.m(-2)s(-1) for S2, and high intensity (HI) (102 and 100 mu mol.m(-2)s(-1) for S1 and S2, respectively)] on growth and antioxidant compound contents in two leafy vegetables: endive (Cichorium endivia L.) and lettuce (Lactuca saliva L.). Fresh weight (FW), dry weight (DW), and DW% of plants were taken as growth indicators. In addition, leaf number, soil plant analysis development index, leaf area (LA), and specific leaf area were also evaluated. Antioxidant synthesis was measured as total phenol content, total flavonoid content, and antioxidant activity. The results showed that S2 and HI increased the FW, DW, and LA in both species. On the other hand, antioxidant compound contents were significantly increased by HI but did not vary with the spectnun.

AB  - There are several LED lamps on the market that were not designed to produce lettuce; however, they can be purchased at a low cost. In Mexico there is a lack of research on its use in small-scale vertical farms with hydroponics established in urban agriculture. The objective of this work was to measure the response of three commercial lamps with LED lights on the growth and morphogenesis of sangria lettuce grown in a lowcost home vertical farm. The sangria lettuce was subjected to three light intensities with different spectra and photoperiod. After 30 days of growth the plant height, leaf length, leaf width, number of leaves and fresh weight were measured, with these measurements a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed and Duncan's multiple comparison method was used through an algorithm designed in Python. According to the results, the highest fresh weight was observed for a light intensity of 5700 lux. In the 2100 lux treatment, the highest height of the plant was observed and it was the treatment with the highest energy consumption. The production of lettuce at home is technically feasible, however, in addition to the light intensity, it is necessary to evaluate the quality (wavelengths) from the agronomic point of view.

AB  - Background: There is recognition that a reduction of consumer demand for foods that have large environmental footprints is necessary. Recent innovations in food production technologies ("food frontiers") claim to offer gains in ecological sustainability and global food security, thereby transitioning our food system toward a more sustainable future. Yet, scientific evidence to support these claims has not been critically reviewed for several high profile innovations. Scope and approach: In this paper, we undertake a critical review of the literature on five food frontiers: cellular agriculture, climate-driven northern agricultural expansion (NAE), controlled environment agriculture (CEA), entomophagy, and seaweed aquaculture. We estimate the feasibility of each frontier's widespread implementation by 2050 and their potential positive impacts on food system sustainability. We highlight uncertainty regarding ecological tradeoffs and future production potential in the literature, research gaps, and policy pathways that may maximize the benefits of these food frontiers. Key findings and conclusions: Entomophagy, cellular agriculture, CEA, and seaweed aquaculture have similar positive impact values. Yet, CEA appears to be the most feasible technology to implement at scale. The mixed potential impacts of NAE suggest that such expansion poses multiple risks to the global food system. Standardized approaches to modeling environmental parameters in life cycle analyses are required, so that predicted impacts can be reasonably compared within and among these bodies of literature. Further critical social scientific engagement is needed to better understand the political and institutional frameworks in which these food frontiers will be implemented.

AB  - Plant factories with artificial lighting (PFALs), with well-insulated and airtight structures, enable the production of large quantities of high-quality plants year-round while achieving high resource use efficiency. However, despite the controlled environment in PFALs, variations in plant individuals have been found, which affect productivity in PFAL operations. Plant phenotyping plays a crucial role in understanding how the surrounding microenvironment affects variations in plant phenotypes. In the current study, a modular phenotyping system for seedling production was developed, focusing on practicality and scalability in commercial PFALs. Experiments on seedlings, which strongly affect productivity, were conducted to obtain cotyledon unfolding time and the time series projected area of cotyledons and true leaves of individual seedlings of romaine lettuce (Lactuca sativa L. var. longifolia), using RGB images. This was also undertaken to analyze how the surrounding microenvironment of photosynthetic photon flux densities and nutrients affect growth variations for plant cohort research. In agreement with the actual measurements, variations in seedling growth were identified even under similar microenvironments. Furthermore, the results demonstrated larger variations in seedlings with higher relative growth. Aiming for simplified interactions of phenotypes with the microenvironment, management, and genotype, seedling selection and breeding with plant production in PFALs may enable plant uniformity and higher productivity.

AB  - Vertical farming is the practice of growing crops vertically to increase total yield for a given space and is one approach toward sustainable food production. Concerns related with its operational costs, and the need to optimize plant growth parameters in a controlled environment call for advanced use of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to develop low-cost mechanisms for continuous monitoring and optimization of vertical farming processes. This article lays the groundwork for such mechanisms, providing an extensible, edge-centric architecture for IoT-supported autonomous vertical farm monitoring and management. We study alternative deployment strategies for it, exploring the design and performance implications of using LoRaWAN as the device connectivity substrate. We show experimentally that it is possible to handle vertical farm monitoring workloads corresponding to thousands of IoT devices, even when operating purely on minimal edge compute infrastructure, making it feasible to support the management of vertical farms cheaply and at scale.

AB  - Dwarf tomatoes are advantageous when cultivated in a plant factory with artificial light because they can grow well in a small volume. However, few studies have been reported on cultivation in a controlled environment for improving productivity. We performed two experiments to investigate the effects of photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD; 300, 500, and 700 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) with white light and light quality (white, R3B1 (red:blue = 3:1), and R9B1) with a PPFD of 300 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) on plant growth and radiation-use efficiency (RUE) of a dwarf tomato cultivar ('Micro-Tom') at the vegetative growth stage. The results clearly demonstrated that higher PPFD leads to higher dry mass and lower specific leaf area, but it does not affect the stem length. Furthermore, high PPFD increased the photosynthetic rate (Pn) of individual leaves but decreased RUE. A higher blue light proportion inhibited dry mass production with the same intercepted light because the leaves under high blue light proportion had low Pn and photosynthetic light-use efficiency. In conclusion, 300 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) PPFD and R9B1 are the recommended proper PPFD and light quality, respectively, for 'Micro-Tom' cultivation at the vegetative growth stage to increase the RUE.

AB  - Fast growth and rapid turnover is an important crop trait in controlled environment agriculture (CEA) due to its high cost. An ideal screening approach for fast-growing cultivars should detect desirable phenotypes non-invasively at an early growth stage, based on morphological and/or physiological traits. Hence, we established a rapid screening protocol based on a simple chlorophyll fluorescence imaging (CFI) technique to quantify the projected canopy size (PCS) of plants, combined with electron transport rate (ETR) measurements using a chlorophyll fluorometer. Eleven lettuce cultivars (Lactuca sativa), selected based on morphological differences, were grown in a greenhouse and imaged twice a week. Shoot dry weight (DW) of green cultivars at harvest 51 days after germination (DAG) was correlated with PCS at 13 DAG (R-2 = 0.74), when the first true leaves had just appeared and the PCS was <8.5 cm(2). However, early PCS of high anthocyanin (red) cultivars was not predictive of DW. Because light absorption by anthocyanins reduces the amount of photons available for photosynthesis, anthocyanins lower light use efficiency (LUE; DW/total incident light on canopy over the cropping cycle) and reduce growth. Additionally, the total incident light on the canopy throughout the cropping cycle explained 90% and 55% of variability in DW within green and red cultivars, respectively. Estimated leaf level ETR at a photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) of 200 or 1000 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) were not correlated with DW in either green or red cultivars. In conclusion, early PCS quantification is a useful tool for the selection of fast-growing green lettuce phenotypes. However, this approach may not work in cultivars with high anthocyanin content because anthocyanins direct excitation energy away from photosynthesis and growth, weakening the correlation between incident light and growth.

AB  - Plant growth prediction is challenging, as the growth rate varies depending on environmental factors. It is an essential task for efficient cultivation in controlled environments, such as in plant factories. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning network for predicting future plant images from a number of past and current images. In particular, our focus is on the estimation of leaf shape in a plant, because the amount of plant growth is commonly quantified based on the leaf area. A spatial transform is applied to a sequence of plant images within the network, and the growth behavior is measured using a set of affine transform parameters. Instead of conventional sequential image fusion, the affine transform parameters for all pairs of successive images are fused together to predict the shape of the future plant image. Then, an RGB reconstruction subnet divides the plants into multiple patches to make global and local growth predictions based on hierarchical auto-encoders. A variety of experimental results show that the proposed network is robust to dynamic plant movements and can accurately predict the shapes of future plant images.

AB  - Dwarf cherry tomatoes 'Red Robin' and 'Tiny Tim Red' were cultivated in two sections. The two sections were set as (1) section irradiated only by fluorescent lamps (main wavelengths 433, 543, and 610 nm; 230 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1) of photosynthetic photon flux density) and non-treated with UV-A irradiation (hereafter, non-UVA), and (2) section irradiated with fluorescent lamps and treated with UV-A irradiation (maximum peak emission: 352 nm; 15.1 W.m(-2) ultraviolet radiation intensity; hereafter, t-UVA). The fruit weight per plant and the number of fruits per plant were not significantly affected by cultivar or section. Regarding fruit quality, the fruit cracking rate was lower in the t-UVA than in non-UVA section. There were no anatomical or histochemical differences in fruit structure or distribution of pigments such as lycopene or beta-carotene, but the shape of the pigment in the epidermal cells was needle-shaped in the non-UVA and unclearly-shaped in the t-UVA, so the pigment shape was different between the two sections. In addition, the number of layers of the hypodermis in the exocarp that accumulated the pigment was smaller in the t-UVA than in non-UVA section. Fruit components in t-UVA showed increased total soluble solids (TSS), titratable acidity (TA), and ascorbic acid content, but a decreased carotenoid content. Therefore, it was shown that UV-A irradiation had a positive effect on the TSS, TA and ascorbic acid content and had a negative effect on the size of the fruit per fruit and the carotenoid content. UV irradiation did not affect the yield per plant. Comparing 'Red Robin' and 'Tiny Tim Red', there was no significant difference in yield, but the fruit size of 'Red Robin' was larger, while and the fruit component of 'Tiny Tim Red' was higher than that of 'Red Robin'. In conclusion, when cultivating tomato plants in a plant factory, further improvements in fruit size and composition are expected by appropriately adjusting the time and intensity of UV irradiation for each cultivar.

AB  - Indoor vertical hydroponics is one of the most recent agricultural technologies introduced. It is a method of growing plants in vertically stacked layers using water and nutrient solutions instead of soil. When cultivating such a system, utilizing and maintaining the quality of water and nutrients is critical for plant growth. Additionally, LED growth lights have a significant effect on plants. Despite developments in LED lighting and Internet of Things based smart agriculture systems, there is a lack of information on LED lighting for hydroponically grown crops in vertical culture since vertical agriculture is a relatively new field of study. Thus, this research aimed to develop an Internet of Things based agricultural system to automated control LED-based artificial lighting on crop cultivation and explore the effects of different LED lights on plant growth. Numerous sensors were installed and monitored to measure the Potential of Hydrogen ion, Electrical Conductivity, and other parameters in the Internet of Things based system. The Blynk application can remotely control the LEDs and monitor the entire sensor and actuator. As for the effects of LED light, particularly the red and blue light, we utilize a case study of three LED grow light models from the manufacturer as light treatments for cultivating green leaf lettuce (Lactuca sativa). The result showed that increased red light (RED/BLUE = 2:1) increased plant height, leaf width, and leaf length on both harvesting days (10 and 20 day after transplanting). The lettuce plant shape and size signify that the lettuces in each tier are of a good standard and comparable in size.

AB  - The reduced requirement for nutrients in vertical farming (VF) implies that the potential for lower environmental impact is greater in VF than in conventional farming. In this study, the environmental impacts of VF were evaluated based on a case study of VF for vegetables in Miyagi Prefecture in Japan, where VF has been utilized in post-disaster relief operations in the wake of the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake. The nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) footprints of these VFs were determined and analyzed to quantify the potential reduction in N and P emissions. First, the N and P footprints in conventional farming were calculated. Then, those footprints were compared with three different scenarios with different ratios for food imports, which equate to different levels of food self-sufficiency. The results show a decrease in the N and P footprints with increased prefectural self-sufficiency due to the introduction of VF. In addition to reducing the risks to food supply by reducing the dependence on imports and the environmental impacts of agriculture, further analysis reveals that VF is suitable for use in many scenarios around the world to reliably provide food to local communities. Its low vulnerability to natural disasters makes VF well suited to places most at risk from climate change anomalies.

AB  - Plant Factory is a newly emerging industry aiming at transforming crop production to an unprecedented model by leveraging industrial automation and informatics. However, today's plant factory and vertical farming industry are still in a primitive phase, and existing industrial cyber-physical systems are not optimal for a plant factory due to diverse application requirements on communication, computing and artificial intelligence. In this paper, we review use cases and requirements for future plant factories, and then dedicate an architecture that incorporates the communication and computing domains to plant factories with a preliminary proof-of-concept, which has been validated by both academic and industrial practices. We also call for a holistic co-design methodology that crosses the boundaries of communication, computing and artificial intelligence disciplines to guarantee the completeness of solution design and to speed up engineering implementation of plant factories and other industries sharing the same demands.

AB  - When used in closed-type plant factories, light-emitting diode (LED) illumination systems have the particular advantages of low heat emission and high luminous efficiency. The effects of illumination quality and intensity on the growth and morphogenesis of many plant species have been examined, but improvements are needed to optimize the illumination systems for better plant products with lower resource investments. In particular, new strategies are needed to reduce the wastage of plant products related to leaf senescence, and to better control the ingredients and appearance of leafy vegetables. Although the quality of light is often altered to change the characteristics of plant products, the transcriptional status underlying the physiological responses of plants to light has not been established. Herein, we performed a comprehensive gene expression analysis using RNA-sequencing to determine how red, blue, and red/blue LEDs and fluorescent light sources affect transcriptome involved in the leaf aging of leaf lettuce. The RNA-sequencing profiling revealed clear differences in the transcriptome between young and old leaves. Red LED light caused large variation between the two age classes, while a pure or mixed blue LED light spectrum induced fewer transcriptome differences between young and old leaves. Collectively, the expression levels of genes that showed homology with those of other model organisms provide a detailed physiological overview, incorporating such characteristics as the senescence, nutrient deficiency, and anthocyanin synthesis of the leaf lettuce plants. Our findings suggest that transcriptome profiles of leaf lettuce grown under different light sources provide helpful information to achieve better growth conditions for marketable and efficient green-vegetable production, with improved wastage control and efficient nutrient inputs.

AB  - By 2050, more than 80% of the world's population will live in metropolitan conurbations. From a holstic and circular economy perspective, strategies for urban resilience that include universal access to food and alimentary security will be essential. This paper investigates the integration of existing traditional urban farming systems with new vertical farming techniques. The proposal is for an infrastructural strategy that improves human-environment interaction through the development of agricultural production on an intermediate scale and through architectural elements - such as urban vertical farms - configured as modular landmarks that respond to the technological complexity of the ago-industrial chain and can be adapted to different contexts, thus defining an inclusive and sustainable urban landscape.

AB  - By 2050, the global population is estimated to rise to over 9 billion people, and the global food need is expected to ascend 50%. Moreover, by cause of climate change, agricultural production may decrease by 10%. Since cultivable land is constant, multi-layered farms are feasible alternatives to yield extra food from the unit land. Smart systems are logical options to assist production in these factory-like farms. When the amount of food grown per season is assessed, a single indoor hectare of a vertical farm could deliver yield equal to more than 30 hectares of land consuming 70% less water with nearly zero usage of pesticides. In this study, we evaluated technology selection for three vertical farm alternatives via MCDM methods. Even though commercial vertical farms are set up in several countries, area is still fresh and acquiring precise data is difficult. Therefore, we employed fuzzy logic as much as possible to overcome related uncertainties. WEDBA (Weighted Euclidean Distance Based Approximation) and MACBETH (Measuring Attractiveness by a Categorical Based Evaluation Technique) methods are employed to evaluate alternatives.

AB  - Vertical farming is on its way to becoming an addition to conventional agricultural practices, improving sustainable food production for the growing world population under increasing climate stress. While the early development of vertical farming systems mainly focused on technological advancement through design innovation, the automation of hydroponic cultivation, and advanced LED lighting systems, more recent studies focus on the resilience and circularity of vertical farming. These sustainability objectives are addressed by investigating water quality and microbial life in a hydroponic cultivation context. Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) have been shown to improve plant performance and resilience to biotic and abiotic stresses. The application of PGPRs to plant-growing media increases microbial functional diversity, creating opportunities to improve the circularity and resilience of vertical farming systems by reducing our dependency on chemical fertilizers and crop protection products. Here, we give a brief historical overview of vertical farming, review its opportunities and challenges in an economic, environmental, social, and political context, and discuss advances in exploiting the rhizosphere microbiome in hydroponic cultivation systems.

AB  - The significant effects of lighting on plants have been extensively investigated, but research has rarely studied the impact of different lighting directions for the strawberry plant. To understand the optimal lighting direction for better growth and development, this study investigated how strawberries respond to variations in the lighting direction to help fine-tune the growth environment for their development. We examined how the lighting direction affects plant morphophysiology by investigating plant growth parameters, leaf anatomy, epidermal cell elongation, stomatal properties, physiological characteristics, and expressions of runner induction-related genes (FaSOC1 and FaTFL1) and gibberellin (GA) biosyntheses-related genes (FaGA20ox2 and FaGA20ox4). In closed-type plant factory units, the rooted cuttings of strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa Duch.) 'Suhlyang' were subjected to a 10-h photoperiod with a 350 mu mol center dot m(-2)center dot s(-1) photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) provided by light-emitting diodes (LEDs) from three directions relative to the plants: top, side, and bottom. Our results demonstrated that the side lighting profoundly promoted not only morphophysiology, but also runner formation, by upregulating photosynthesis in strawberries. Side lighting can bring commercial benefits, which include reduced economic costs, easier controllability, and harmlessness to plants. This will help provide new insights for the propagation of the most commonly cultivated strawberries in South Korea.

AB  - This study investigated a light sensor function of light-emitting diodes (LEDs), the use of which is expanding in plant cultivations. Unimodal spectral LEDs of four types with respective emission peak wavelengths of 464, 501, 634, and 849 nm, and a white LED with a bimodal spectrum with 455-nm primary and 574-nm secondary peaks were used for this study. Open circuit voltage (VOC) of up to 1-2 V was induced in the LEDs when they were irradiated with sunlight. The VOC value of the 634 nm LED saturated with a low photon flux density can be used for binary discrimination between daylight and night. Each LED had a VOC inducible threshold wavelength of incident light. By virtue of the wavelength threshold feature, existence of a plant leaf between a light source and the LEDs is detectable by comparing the VOC values of blue-green range LEDs (464 nm, 501 nm) and near-infrared (NIR) LEDs (849 nm). Under leaf shadow, the NIR LED VOC exceeded those of the blue-green range LEDs. Under natural incident sunlight, the VOCs of the blue-green range LEDs were greater than that of the NIR LED. Another function of LEDs in agricultural use has been demonstrated.

AB  - It is necessary to optimize and homogenize the environmental conditions in plant factories. We installed sensors to observe the environmental factors in a plant factory and evaluated lettuce growth. We found that the integrated quantity of PPFD (Photosynthetic Photon Flux Density) is correlated with fresh weight of harvested leaf lettuces and that lettuce density also affects growth. There is the relationship between adjacent and central plant stocks. The influence of planting density was observed, and thinning improved the growing conditions at many planting positions. On the other hand, it was concluded that the air temperature and humidity were uniform in the plant cultivation bed and did not affect the growing condition. It was observed that the air temperature, humidity and wind speed were affected when the cultivation bed was in front of the air conditioning port. The CO2 concentration was controlled within a range that did not affect the growth.

AB  - Simple Summary This paper focuses on the role of phytochromes (phys) in the interaction between green light and far-red light effects on "shade avoidance syndrome". We grew wild type and phy mutants of tomato under a set of light conditions with different combinations of green, blue, red, and far-red light. Partial (20%) replacement of red/blue by green light in the absence of far-red light hardly affected the tomato plant morphology. However, when the spectrum contained far-red light, partially replacing red/blue by green light resulted in more elongation, which was associated with a lower phytochrome photostationary state (PSS) value. There was no effect of partial substitution of red/blue with green light when the PSS was kept constant. Thus, this study has revealed an interaction between green and far-red light effects on elongation unless PSS was kept constant. Green light was often a bit neglected in photobiology, but now an increasing number of researchers are realizing that green light deserves more attention. This study advances the understanding of light quality and plant growth and finding the optimal spectrum when growing plants under LED lighting in controlled environment agriculture. Green light (G) could trigger a "shade avoidance syndrome" (SAS) similarly to far-red light. We aimed to test the hypothesis that G interacts with far-red light to induce SAS, with this interaction mediated by phytochromes (phys). The tomato (Solanum lycopersicum cv. Moneymaker) wild-type (WT) and phyA, phyB1B2, and phyAB1B2 mutants were grown in a climate room with or without 30 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) G on red/blue and red/blue/far-red backgrounds, maintaining the same photosynthetically active radiation (400-700 nm) of 150 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) and red/blue ratio of 3. G hardly affected the dry mass accumulation or leaf area of WT, phyA, and phyB1B2 with or without far-red light. A lower phytochrome photostationary state (PSS) by adding far-red light significantly increased the total dry mass by enhancing the leaf area in WT plants but not in phy mutants. When the background light did not contain far-red light, partially replacing red/blue with G did not significantly affect stem elongation. However, when the background light contained far-red light, partially replacing red/blue with G enhanced elongation only when associated with a decrease in PSS, indicating that G interacts with far-red light on elongation only when the PSS changes.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate short-duration (24 h) UV-B irradiation as a preharvest abiotic stressor in canola plants. Moreover, we quantified the expression levels of genes related to bioactive compounds synthesis in response to UV-B radiation. Canola seedlings were cultivated in a plant factory under artificial light (200 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) photosynthetic photon flux density; white LED lamps; 16 h on/8 h off), 25 degrees C/20 degrees C daytime/nighttime air temperature, and 70% relative humidity. Eighteen days after sowing, the seedlings were subjected to supplemental UV-B treatment. The control plants received no UV-B irradiation. The plants were exposed to 3, 5, or 7 W m(-2) UV-B irradiation. There were no significant differences in shoot fresh weight between the UV-B-irradiated and control plants. With increasing UV-B irradiation intensity and exposure time, the H2O2 content gradually increased, the expression levels of genes related to photosynthesis downregulated, and phenylpropanoid and flavonoid production, and also total phenolic, flavonoid, antioxidant, and anthocyanin concentrations were significantly enhanced. The genes related to secondary metabolite biosynthesis were immediately upregulated after UV-B irradiation. The relative gene expression patterns identified using qRT-PCR corroborated the variations in gene expression that were revealed using microarray analysis. The time point at which the genes were induced varied with the gene location along the biosynthetic pathway. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate a temporal difference between the accumulation of antioxidants and the induction of genes related to the synthesis of this compound in UV-B-treated canola plants. Our results demonstrated that short-term UV-B irradiation could augment antioxidant biosynthesis in canola without sacrificing crop yield or quality.

AB  - Chinese kale baby leaves were hydroponically cultured under the basal light (Red: white LEDs = 2:3 at PPFD of 250 mu mol center dot m(-2)center dot s(-1)) with different supplemental lighting, including individual ultraviolet-A (UV-A, 380 +/- 10 nm, 20 mu mol center dot m(-2)center dot s(-1)), far-red (FR, 735 +/- 10 nm, 30 mu mol center dot m(-2)center dot s(-1)) light, and their combination (UF) radiation in an artificial light plant factory. Effects of supplemental light qualities on morphology and physiology as well as health-promoting compounds of Chinese kale baby leaves were investigated. Application of UV-A and FR presented a positive effect on biomass, with a pronounced increase in petiole length, stem diameter, main stem length, and leaf area. Notably, plants under UF grew more vigorously than under other treatments. Higher levels of FRAP, vitamin C, total phenolic, and flavonoid were observed in plants under UV-A, while no striking changes or a decreasing trend recorded under FR and UF. Moreover, UV-A enhanced the glucosinolates (GLs) accumulation in Chinese kale baby leaves by increasing the predominant GLs (glucoraphanin and glucobrassicin) contents. RT-qPCR results indicated that UV-A upregulated the gene expressions of transcription factors and core structure genes related to GLs biosynthesis. However, downregulated or unchanged gene expressions of GLs biosynthesis-related genes in Chinese kale baby leaves were observed in FR and UF. Therefore, UV-A was benefited for the production of functional substances, while FR was conducive to a significant increase in crop yield. The combination of UV-A and FR, as a balance between yield and production of secondary metabolite, provided a new perspective for the application of artificial light in horticultural crop production.

AB  - With increasing urbanisation and consumer concerns over food miles, indoor urban plant factories are gaining popularity. These offer precise regulation of the crop environment, but optimal light requirements vary between species and according to grower specifications. Here we introduce a novel assessment framework to optimise light quality in urban plant factories accounting for yield, resource use efficiency and flavour, factors that have only been studied separately in previous research. Yield, water and energy use efficiency and flavour of sweet basil (Ocimum basilicum cv. Genovese) and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum cv. Micro-Tom) were determined for plants grown supplied with 100% blue, 66% blue + 33% red, 33% blue + 66% red, or 100% red lighting. In both species, 66% red and 100% red optimised water use efficiency and energy use respectively. For basil, 100% blue light maximised leaf biomass, while 66% red enhanced leaf flavouring volatiles. In Micro-Tom, all treatments produced similar fruit biomass, but 100% red light enhanced flavour-related volatiles in foliage. By considering trade-offs between yield, efficiency and flavour, growers can select bespoke lighting treatments to optimise their product according to specific market demands and minimise environmental impacts.

AB  - Vertical farming (VF) is a new idea for supplying food inside the cities. Therefore, there is a lack of academic research concerning community acceptance (CA) of VF. This study aims to identify the CA factors of VF in Kuala Lumpur (KL). The results are based on interviews with experts as well as a questionnaire survey, that says eight factors, Perceived Benefit, Perceived Risk, Location, Demographic characteristics, Value and Belief, Trust, Fairness, and Knowledge are affecting the CA of VF in KL. Also, the results revealed that the analysis of the related literature was different from the significant factors. Then the underlying components of these factors were identified and a new framework was developed. The findings of this study could positively contribute to knowledge generation, stakeholder network establishment, new project implementation, and improvement of the general perception of VF.

AB  - Vertical farming can produce food in a climate-resilient manner, potentially emitting zero pesticides and fertilizers, and with lower land and water use than conventional agriculture. Vertical farming systems (VFS) can meet daily consumer demands for nutritious fresh products, forming a part of resilient food systems-particularly in and around densely populated areas. VFS currently produce a limited range of crops including fruits, vegetables and herbs, but successful implementation of vertical farming as part of mainstream agriculture will require improvements in profitability, energy efficiency, public policy and consumer acceptance. Here we discuss VFS as multi-layer indoor crop cultivation systems, exploring state-of-the-art vertical farming and future challenges in the fields of plant growth, product quality, automation, robotics, system control and environmental sustainability and how research and development, socio-economic and policy-related institutions must work together to ensure successful upscaling of VFS to future food systems.
   Vertical farming systems have the potential to form a part of resilient food systems through the production of reliable, high-quality crops in urban landscapes. This Review explores how multi-layer indoor crop cultivation systems currently operate and the conditions needed to upscale and support their integration into mainstream agriculture.

AB  - Vertical farming is considered to play a crucial role in future food supply. Until today, the high amount of electrical energy required for artificial lighting has been problematic in this context. Various possibilities for increasing efficiency through adapted lighting conditions have been and are being investigated. However, comparably little attention is paid to increasing utilance, i.e., the amount of photons that can effectively be used by the plant. In this work, a novel targeted lighting strategy is therefore proposed that allows for a dynamic adaptation of the luminaires' light distribution to match the effective crop size at each stage of plant growth in a fully-automated manner. It is shown that the resulting utilance can significantly be increased compared to standard full-coverage lighting. Moreover, it is found that the proposed strategy is likely to consume less than half of the electrical energy usually required for the latter. An additional increase in system efficiency can be prognosticated and the potential energy savings are estimated based on assumptions of future LED generations derived from literature.

AB  - Climate and social changes are deeply affecting current agro-food systems. Unsustainable agricultural practices and the low profitability of small farmers are challenging the agricultural development of rural areas. This study aims to develop a novel, modular and low-cost vertical hydroponic farm system through reviews of the patented literature, research literature and variants of commercial products. After a detailed conceptualization process, a prototype was fabricated and tested at my university to validate its technology readiness level (TRL). The outcomes supported the usability and performance of the present utility model but highlighted several changes that are necessary before it can pass to the next TRL. This study shows that the prototype has the potential to not only solve food sovereignty but also to benefit society by advancing the innovations in food production and improving quality of life.

AB  - The objectives were to characterize and compare shrinkage (i.e., transplant loss) and growth of tissue-cultured blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum) transplants acclimated in greenhouses or indoors under 1) different photosynthetic photon flux densities (PPFDs) (Expt. 1); or 2) spectral changes over time using broad-spectrum white (W; 400 to 700 nm) light-emitting diodes (LEDs) without or with red or far-red (FR) radiation (Expt. 2). In Expt. 1, 'Emerald' and 'Snowchaser' transplants were acclimated for 8 weeks under PPFDs of 35, 70, 105, or 140 +/- 5 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1) provided by W LED fixtures for 20 h.d(-1). In another treatment, PPFD was increased over time by moving transplants from treatment compartments providing 70 to 140 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1) at the end of week 4. Transplants were also acclimated in either a research or a commercial greenhouse (RGH or CGH, respectively). Shrinkage was unaffected by PPFD, but all transplants acclimated indoors had lower shrinkage (<= 4%) than those in the greenhouse (15% and 17% in RGH and CGH, respectively), and generally produced more shoot and root biomass, regardless of PPFD. Growth responses to increasing PPFD were linear in most cases, although treatment effects after finishing were generally not significant among PPFD treatments. In Expt. 2, 'Emerald' transplants were acclimated for 8 weeks under constant W, W + red (WR), or W + FR (WFR) radiation, all of which provided a PPFD of 70 +/- 2 lmol.m(-2).s(-1) for 20 h.d(-1). At the end of week 4, a group of transplants from WR and WFR were moved to treatment compartments with W (WRW or WFRW, respectively) or from W to a research greenhouse (W-GH), where another group of transplants were also acclimated for 8 weeks (GH). Shrinkage of transplants acclimated indoors was also low in Expt. 2, ranging from 1% to 4%. In contrast, shrinkage of transplants acclimated in GH or under W-GH was 37% or 14%, respectively. Growth of indoor-acclimated transplants was generally greater than that in GH or under W-GH. Although growth responses were generally similar indoors, plants acclimated under WFR had a higher root dry mass (DM) and longer roots compared with GH and W-GH.

AB  - Sunlight is an abundant source of green energy that gives an energy-saving solution when introduced into a plant factory. However, a limitation point of applying sunlight is that it is unstable on cloudy and rainy days, and it fluctuates by seasons. Aiming to produce strawberry in subtropical areas, we investigated the effects of different light conditions on photosynthetic responses and reproductive ability of strawberry grown in a closed-type plant factory using sunlight (solar plant factory, SPF). The strawberries were grown under two different light conditions [full sunlight (S) or 10% sunlight + fluorescent light (SA)] with a CO2 concentration of 1,200 pmol mol-1 and a relative humidity of 50% +/- 10%. The results showed that under long-day conditions, the response of net photosynthetic rate (Pn) of the strawberries leaves to different light levels did not differ between the two light conditions and was equal to that of plants grown in a CO2-enriched greenhouse. However, due to lower light intensity under short-day conditions, the response of Pn of the plants was significantly reduced in S treatment compared with that in SA treatment. Supplemented lighting to stabilize the light intensity showed effectiveness in improving Pn under the short-day conditions. The strawberries grown in SPF showed a high potential to produce flowers and fruits, which were not inferior to those under other controlled environment productions. These results can be overcome by additional lighting utilization.

AB  - Three different LED spectra (W: White light; WFR: W + far-red light; WB: W + blue light) with similar photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) were designed to explore the effects of supplementary far-red and blue lights on leaf color, biomass and phytochemicals of two cultivars of red-leaf lettuce ("Yanzhi" and "Red Butter") in an artificial lighting plant factory. Lettuce plants under WB had redder leaf color and significantly higher contents of pigments, such as chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, chlorophyll (a + b) and anthocyanins. The accumulation of health-promoting compounds, such as vitamin C, vitamin A, total phenolic compounds, total flavonoids and anthocyanins in the two lettuce cultivars were obviously enhanced by WB. Lettuce under WFR showed remarkable increase in fresh weight and dry weight; meanwhile, significant decreases of pigments, total phenolic compounds, total flavonoids and vitamin C were found. Thus, in the plant factory system, the application of WB can improve the coloration and quality of red leaf lettuce while WFR was encouraged for the purpose of elevating the yield of lettuce.

AB  - The development of various types of plant factories is central to improving agriculture. In one form, it is expanding from the existing commercial plant factories to home cultivation systems or cultivators. The plant cultivation system grafted into the living space for people produces differences in the growth of the plant depending on the lifestyle (cooling and heating, residence time, number of residents, etc.) of the resident. In this study, identical home cultivation systems that automatically adjust environmental conditions (temperature, photoperiod, light, and nutrient solution supply) other than the carbon dioxide level were set in an office and warehouse. The study confirmed how plant growth can differ depending on the amount of carbon dioxide generated by humans occupying the space. In addition, it was confirmed whether the growth of plants can be further promoted depending on the external air exchange speed by a ventilation fan even if the indoor carbon dioxide concentration is the same. Due to the nature of the cultivation system that controls the temperature, the type and speed of the fan were set to minimize heat loss in the cultivator. The airspeed from ventilation fans attached to the indoor cultivation systems of an office and warehouse was adjusted to one of three levels (0.7, 1.0, or 1.3 m center dot s(-1)). In this study with two species, Ssamchoo and Romaine, it was confirmed that the office space was significantly advantageous for the growth of Ssamchoo, especially in terms of the fresh weight, root activity, and chlorophyll content. Romaine also had a significantly higher fresh weight when grown in the office. Shoot length, leaf length, and leaf width were longer, and there were more leaves. When comparing the relative yield based on an airspeed of 1.0 m center dot s(-1), the yield increased up to 156.9% more in the office than in the warehouse. The fan airspeed had an important influence on Ssamchoo. The higher the fan airspeed, the greater the yield, root activity, and chlorophyll. However, fan airspeed had no consistent effect on the growth tendencies of Romaine. In conclusion, carbon dioxide produced by humans occupying the space is a significant source of carbon dioxide for plants grown in the home cultivation system, although both the speed of the ventilation fan that can promote growth without heat loss and delayed growth caused by the photorespiration in a carbon dioxide-limited situation require additional experiments.

AB  - To secure sustainable and resilient food systems, new approaches, innovations, techniques, and processes are needed. In recent years, urban farming firms have been developing and experimenting with innovative approaches to expand their offerings and connect with consumers in new ways. New business models are being developed to provide functions and services instead of traditional products to meet demands from consumers, retailers, and users. As such, modular growing systems are increasing in popularity to provide fresh produce, visual appeal, transparency, and other tailor-made functions and services in so-called "growing-service systems" (GSS). Using GSS approaches, firms are developing and providing modular and small-scale farms in restaurants, residential spaces, supermarkets, and other commercial spaces, often including a large degree of automation and optimization of digital solutions to remotely control their operation. Using qualitative methods, the aim of this study is to explore and analyze the development of these novel GSS systems, highlighting different strategies, business models, motivations, and challenges. The results illustrate the divergence in approaches to GSSs for vertical farming. This includes different scales of modular units and varying business models for capturing value from the combination of products and services. All of the systems include varying degrees of automation and digitalized solutions to ensure the services are monitored, which is done to improve growing conditions and improve the experience for the users. Business-to-business systems are being developed as both market expansion and awareness-building strategies, where modular units are provided as a rental or subscription model that includes a number of services. Business-to-consumer systems are being introduced as an alternative for consumers, particularly in urban areas, to have greater control and access over growing their own fresh produce. The modules are purchased by consumers, which includes a number of ongoing services from the GSS firms. By categorizing and exploring these systems, this article offers novel insights and a first endeavor to distinguish these new GSS systems in the growing segment of urban agriculture, controlled-environment agriculture, and product-service system literature.

AB  - Mesona chinensis Benth (MCB) is an important Chinese herbal medicine. The plant factories might be one of the ways to solve the shortage of MCB supply. In this study, the MCB seedlings were treated under the red (R) and blue (B) lights in the plant factory. Results showed that the red light promoted the growth and development of MCB in comparison with the blue light. Under the red-light condition, the biomass, plant height, and root characteristics were significantly higher than those under blue-light condition, while the soil and plant analyzer development (SPAD) under the red-light treatment was significantly lower than that under the blue-light treatment. Red light also significantly promoted the content of soluble sugar and pectin of MCB compared with blue light. Transcriptome analysis showed that a total of 4,165 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected including 2,034 upregulated and 2,131 downregulated. Of these, 1,112 DEGs including 410 upregulated and 702 downregulated genes were associated with 111 pathways. Moreover, a total of 8,723 differentially expressed transcription factors (TFs) were identified in R vs. B, and these TFs were distributed in 56 gene families. Metabonomic results revealed that a total of 184 metabolites and 99 differentially expressed metabolites (DEMs) (42 upregulated and 57 downregulated) were identified in the red- and blue-light treatments. Integrative analysis of transcriptome and metabolome unveiled that a total of 24 pathways included 70 compounds (metabolites) and were associated with 28 unigenes. In particular, these pathways included starch and sucrose metabolism, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, cysteine and methionine metabolism, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, and pentose and glucuronate interconversions. The unigenes included asparagine synthetase (AS), thymidine kinase (TK), alpha, alpha-trehalose-phosphate synthase (TPS), phosphatase IMPL1 (IMPL1), dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (D4R), and 4-coumarate-CoA ligase-like 6 (4CL6), bifunctional aspartokinase-homoserine dehydrogenase 1 (thrA), and abscisic acid 8 '-hydroxylase 2 isoform X1 (ABA8). It was indicated that these pathways and genes might play important roles in the growth and development of MCB. This study laid a foundation for the future research of MCB.

AB  - The urban hydroponic production system is accelerating industrialization in step with the potentials for reducing environmental impact. In contrast, establishing sustainable fertilizer dosing techniques still lags behind the pace of expansion of the system. The reproducibility of root-zone nutrient dynamics in the system is poorly understood, and managing nutrients has so far primarily relied on periodic discharge or dumping of highly concentrated nutrient solutions. Here, we assayed root-zone nutrient concentration changes using three possible nutrient dosing types. Three Brassica species were hydroponically cultivated in a controlled environment to apply the nutrient absorption and transpiration parameters to the simulation analysis. We found that nutrient dosing based on total ion concentration could provide more reproducible root-zone nutrient dynamics. Our findings highlight the nutrient absorption parameter domain in management practice. This simplifies conventional nutrient management into an optimization problem. Collectively, our framework can be extended to fertilizer-emission-free urban hydroponic production.

AB  - Major changes are needed both with regard to what we eat and how food is produced. The latter is the focus of the present research, specifically the rise of controlled environment agriculture. In this context, empirical research is presented on consumer attitudes to vertical farming (VF) (i.e., indoor plant factory with artificial lighting), conducted in four countries (USA, UK, Singapore, and China) using online surveys (637-683 participants per country with matched gender and age group distributions). A multi-method research approach was used, including a novel methodology of text highlighting, which requires that participants read a descriptive text about VF with mentions of pros and cons and use highlighter functions to select aspects of the text that they 'like' and 'dislike'. Based on the information provided in the text, attitudes towards VF were largely positive in the four countries. The characteristics of VF that aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals were identified as key drivers of positive attitudes (i.e., higher yield, reduction of carbon emissions, and securing access to food). On the other hand, high energy use and premium prices contributed to negative attitudes about VF. Although the majority of participants responded to the text with an overall positive attitude towards VF, there were smaller groups of participants in every country who expressed a negative or neutral/ambivalent attitude. These between-segment differences were larger than cross-cultural differences, although the latter did exist, particularly for selected aspects of VF. For example, Chinese participants tended to be the least negative about the use of robots to help planting and harvesting. Future research is needed to understand consumer responses to aspects VF not covered in the text (e.g., powering VF with renewable energy, product range), and consumer insights about VF should be sought in other countries.

AB  - To increase the crop yield and quality, the plant cultivation in equipped growing systems is an alternative to open field production. Artificial light sources are a critical component in the plant factory systems and red and blue wavelengths have a powerful impact on plant growth and photosynthetic capacity. In this study, the effect of different photon flux ratios of red (R) light to blue (B) LED light including 100 R:0B, 80 R:20B, 50 R:50B, 20 R:80B, 0 R:100B and white LEDs (as control) were evaluated on the growth, flowering and secondary metabolite contents of Hypericum perforatum L. cv. Topas at 150 mu mol m- 2 s- 1 irradiation for a 16/8 h.d-1 photoperiod. Results showed that the plant growth characteristics such as fresh and dry weight, leaf area and number, plant height, flower number and diameter were significantly (P < 0.05) maximum under the enhancement of R/B ratio, especially under 100% red light treatment. Despite the higher transpiration and net photosynthesis rate, photosynthetic pigment concentration, stomatal surface area and RuBisCO activity, the plants under the high fraction of blue light showed the poorest growth and flowering traits. The maximum content of hypericin (14.24 mg g-1 DW), pseudohypericin (25.98 mg g-1 DW) and hyperforin (163.06 mg g-1 DW) was obtained in flower under 100% red LED. Antioxidant enzymes activities (CAT and POD), total phenolic and flavonoid content were also higher in plants exposed to the mixture of red and blue light. Plants grown under white LED were mediocre in terms of growth parameters and secondary metabolites. These findings showed that the 100% red LED light is suitable for H. perforatum plant growth, flowering, as well as secondary metabolites accumulation in the plant factory system.

AB  - Yield prediction for crops is essential information for food security. A high-throughput phenotyping platform (HTPP) generates the data of the complete life cycle of a plant. However, the data are rarely used for yield prediction because of the lack of quality image analysis methods, yield data associated with HTPP, and the time-series analysis method for yield prediction. To overcome limitations, this study employed multiple deep learning (DL) networks to extract high-quality HTTP data, establish an association between HTTP data and the yield performance of crops, and select essential time intervals using machine learning (ML). The images of Arabidopsis were taken 12 times under environmentally controlled HTPP over 23 days after sowing (DAS). First, the features from images were extracted using DL network U-Net with SE-ResXt101 encoder and divided into early (15-21 DAS) and late (similar to 21-23 DAS) pre-flowering developmental stages using the physiological characteristics of the Arabidopsis plant. Second, the late pre-flowering stage at 23 DAS can be predicted using the ML algorithm XGBoost, based only on a portion of the early pre-flowering stage (17-21 DAS). This was confirmed using an additional biological experiment (P < 0.01). Finally, the projected area (PA) was estimated into fresh weight (FW), and the correlation coefficient between FW and predicted FW was calculated as 0.85. This was the first study that analyzed time-series data to predict the FW of related but different developmental stages and predict the PA. The results of this study were informative and enabled the understanding of the FW of Arabidopsis or yield of leafy plants and total biomass consumed in vertical farming. Moreover, this study highlighted the reduction of time-series data for examining interesting traits and future application of time-series analysis in various HTPPs.

AB  - The various monochromatic Light Emitting Diode (LED) lights are widely used in growth facility for cultivating various plants, particularly horticultural crops because of their higher luminous efficiency, lower radiation and power consumption than the traditional white fluorescent lamp light. However, considerable inconsistent effects have been reported in literature. We conducted a meta-analysis to assess the effects of different colors of LED light on plant growth, development and various traits. Compared to the light from white fluorescent lamps, the red LED light significantly changed 4 out 26 plant characteristics by at least 37%, and blue LED light significantly increased 5 of 26 assessed characteristics by 37% or more. The combination of red/blue LED lights only significantly increased dry weight by 161% among 25 plant characteristics analyzed. Compared to the white LED light, red LED light significantly decreased 2 of 9 plant characteristics by at least 36%, and blue LED light significantly decreased only 1 of 9 plant characteristics, total chlorophyll content, by 42%. In the moderators analyzed, plant taxonomic families significantly influenced the effects of LED lights on shoot dry weight, and plant life cycles and plant taxonomic families significantly affected the effect on stomatal conductance. Through systematic meta-analysis, we found that the effect of LED on plant growth and quality traits was speciesspecific, and the effect was affected by the cultivation conditions. Therefore, we suggest that researchers be more targeted to experiment, and collect traits associated with practical production, especially related to the quality of product data, such as carotenoids, anthocyanin and other antioxidant compounds. This article is to provide more data with practical application, guide the application of LED in horticultural plant factory.

AB  - Lettuce (Latuca sativa L.) is a commercially important crop and a good candidate for production in a plant factory with artificial lighting (PFAL). To explore the influence of CO2 enrichment (eCO(2)) on lettuce growth, light-use efficiency (LUE) and various aspects of the growth indicators were specifically assessed. Three CO2 concentrations ([CO2]): ambient CO2 (as the control, approximately 400 mu mol mol(-1)), approximately double the ambient (DA-CO2, 800 +/- 50 mu mol mol(-1)), and approximately quadruple the ambient (QA-CO2, 1600 +/- 50 mu mol mol(-1)) were applied for 30 d. The results indicated that plant height, stem diameter, number of leaves, root length, leaf width, and maximum leaf area were all positively related to [CO2], which illustrated that growth was greater in the treatments with eCO(2) than under ambient CO2. The daily average assimilation rate (DAAR), the average dry weight growth rate (GRdw), and yield were also greater for plants grown under DA-CO2 and QA-CO2 than under ambient CO2 (DAAR increased by 25.45% and 42.27%, GRdw increased by 28.76 and 37.55%, and yield increased by 33.65 and 44.16%, respectively). Light-use efficiency increased by 28.51 and 41.12% for DA-CO2 and QA-CO2 compared with ambient CO2, respectively. We concluded that eCO(2) has the potential to enhance production as well as light utilization in PFAL.

AB  - In order to improve Cinnamoum camphora seedling efficiency, we explored the effects of light quality in plant factories on the growth and photosynthetic characteristics of C. camphora. The results showed that four LED light quality treatments (red light, blue light, red light:blue light = 8:1, red light:blue light:UV-A = 20:5:1) all increased the plant height and leaf number of container seedlings of C. camphora compared to solar light under natural conditions. Under the blue light treatment, C. camphora stocks had the lowest biomass, including number of leaves, plant height, stem diameter, and fresh/dry weight. Under the red light treatment, stomatal conductance, intercellular CO2 concentration, transpiration rate, chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b and carotenoids were the lowest. Compared with the narrow-band red or blue light treatments, plant height, leaf number, fresh weight of aboveground biomass, fresh weight of belowground biomass and chlorophyll a content were significantly increased in both of the polychromatic light treatments. The polychromatic light treatment red light:blue light:UV-A = 20:5:1 significantly increased the net photosynthetic rate of C. camphora. Therefore, the polychromatic light treatment of red and blue light for C. camphora seedlings was better than narrow-band light treatments, and the addition of UV-A radiation was beneficial in cultivating strong seedlings.

AB  - The countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) are considered food secure due to their ability to import sufficient food to meet their populations' demand, despite considerable environmental limitations to conventional agriculture. However, over-reliance on externally produced food leaves these countries vulnerable to food shortages during crises that disrupt international production and shipping. Advanced Controlled Environment Agriculture technology has the potential to improve food self-sufficiency by multiplying vegetable crop yields while optimizing efficiency of agricultural inputs and minimizing land requirements. This paper demonstrates how approximately 15 km(2) of indoor farms or less than 0.1 km(2) of vertical farms could reduce or eliminate the need to import six important vegetable crops in the State of Kuwait. If properly contextualized and supported by clear legislation and well-managed regulatory bodies, indoor agriculture initiatives may provide a pathway for GCC countries to reduce their dependence on imported foods and increase resilience to food supply disruption during disasters or conflict. This case study contextualizes the need for improved food self-sufficiency in light of vulnerabilities from regional and global threats, illuminates unique challenges faced by GCC countries considering adoption of the proposed technologies, and summarizes opportunities inherent in the current legal and policy framework.

AB  - The identification of light stress is crucial for light control in plant factories. Image-based lighting classification of leafy vegetables has exhibited remarkable performance with high convenience and economy. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has been widely used for crop image analysis because of its architecture, high accuracy and efficiency. Among them, large intra-class differences and small inter-class differences are important factors affecting crop identification and a critical challenge for fine-grained classification tasks based on CNN. To address this problem, we took the Lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) widely grown in plant factories as the research object and constructed a leaf image set containing four stress levels. Then a light stress grading model combined with classic pre-trained CNN and Triplet loss function is constructed, which is named Tr-CNN. The model uses the Triplet loss function to constrain the distance of images in the feature space, which can reduce the Euclidean distance of the samples from the same class and increase the heterogeneous Euclidean distance. Multiple sets of experimental results indicate that the model proposed in this paper (Tr-CNN) has obvious advantages in light stress grading dataset and generalized dataset.

AB  - Efficient cultivation methods were investigated to promote the branding of products in plant factories. Moderate stress can enhance plant constituents that are beneficial for human health, without reducing yield. Dehydration stress in lettuce rhizospheres increased some antioxidants, including L-ascorbic acid (AsA) and polyphenols. In this study, the major factors contributing to the augmentation of antioxidant constituents were investigated. The drought treatment resulted in increased hydrophilic oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) values but not hydrophobic ORAC values. Both activities of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, SOD, and ascorbate peroxidase, APX) were elevated under drought conditions. RNA-seq analysis revealed 33 upregulated and 115 downregulated differentially expressed genes, and 40 gene ontology enrichment categories. A dehydrin gene was the most significant among the upregulated genes in response to drought stress. Dehydrin protects plant cells from dryness through multiple functions, such as radical scavenging and protection of enzymes. Real-time PCR validated the substantial increase in some dehydrin paralogs with root desiccation. In conclusion, the enhancement of antioxidant levels by drought stress is likely not due to the induction of antioxidant enzyme genes, but due to increased enzymic activities. These activities might be protected by dehydrins encoded by the upregulated paralogs under drought stress.

AB  - White (W) light-emitting diode (LED) light has been used as an efficient light source for commercial plant cultivation in vertical farming. This study aimed to examine the effect of W LED light sources on the growth and quality of butterhead and romaine lettuce. Three W LED light sources including normal W light (NWL) which has 450 nm as its pumping wavelength and two specific W lights (SWL1 and SWL2) with shorter blue peak wavelength (437 nm) were used to grow lettuce in comparison to a red (R) and blue (B) LED combination. As a result, SWL1 and SWL2 treatments with the same electrical power or photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) resulted in more growth of both lettuce cultivars compared to RB treatment. Some phenolic and flavonol contents were increased in the RB treatment, whereas SWL2 treatment stimulated the accumulation of other phenolic and flavonol compounds. Meanwhile, neither NWL nor SWL1 treatments increased the individual phenolic and flavonol contents in either cultivar (except for some flavonols in romaine lettuce in the SWL1 group). In addition, light and energy use efficiencies were also highest in the SWL1 and SWL2 treatments. These results illustrate the positive effects of specific W LED light on lettuce growth and quality, and suggest that the specific W LED light sources, especially SWL2, could be preferably used in vertical farming.

AB  - Producing food via vertical farming (VF) is an efficient method since it requires less space with increased yield per unit area. Such a system can assist in solving major food-shortage problems since it presents a higher crop yield per unit area compared to conventional farming. Thus, VF can be seen as a production method that can cope with the challenge of the constantly growing population, making it also possible to cultivate crops in regions with adverse climate conditions. However, the public might be concerned about the sustainability of VF systems since plants are produced in an unconventional setting. Therefore, there is a need to consider and evaluate the consumers' acceptance of VF. The particular study attempts to both analyse consumer acceptance of VF in the Nordic areas and offer insights into VF acceptance among young customers in a comparative analysis. The results indicated that VF is not widely accepted by young Nordic consumers. The concept of sustainability is one of the principles driving forces behind consumer acceptance of vertical farms. The more cases of vertical farms in European cities, the better seems to be the level of acceptance among young customers and their willingness to purchase their products.

AB  - Light is one of the most important factors that influence plant growth and development. This study was conducted to examine how lighting direction affects plant morphophysiology by investigating plant growth parameters, leaf anatomy, epidermal cell elongation, stomatal properties, chloroplast arrangement, and physiological changes. In closed-type plant factory units, the rooted cuttings of two chrysanthemum (Chrysanthemum morifolium Ramat.) cultivars, 'Gaya Glory' and 'Pearl Egg', were subjected to a 10 h photoperiod with a 300 mu mol center dot m(-2)center dot s(-1) photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) provided by light-emitting diodes (LEDs) from three directions relative to the plant including the top, side, and bottom. Compared to the top or bottom lighting, the side lighting greatly enhanced the plant growth, improved the leaf internal structure and chloroplast arrangement, induced small stomata with a higher density, and promoted stomatal opening, which is associated with an increased stomatal conductance and photosynthetic efficiency. It is worth noting that the side lighting significantly enhanced the induction of branching and flowering for both cultivars., The plants grown with side lighting consistently exhibited the greatest physiological performance. We conclude that the lighting direction had a profound effect on the morphophysiological characteristics of chrysanthemum, and that side lighting dramatically promoted their growth and development, especially in their branching and flowering.

AB  - The subject of the article concerns vertical urban farms that play an important role in nature-based solutions and ecosystem services for the city. In the face of a changing climate, progressive environmental degradation, and the related loss of agricultural land, vertical farms can be seen as an alternative to traditional agriculture. Woven into the blue-green infrastructure of cities, they may not only constitute a base for food production, but can also create a new valuable ecological, social, and economic hub in contemporary cities, changed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The objective of this paper is to show whether it is possible to introduce various functions which support ecosystem and social services, and whether they affect measurable benefits for urban residents in a large-scale system of solutions in the field of vertical urban agriculture. This research shows that urban vertical farms can perform many functions and bring diverse benefits to the inhabitants of cities. In a multi-scale system, they allow for the creation of patchwork connections, which stabilise a specific city biome in the vertical space.

AB  - Urban farming can improve cities' food security and resilience, but the performance of different farming systems with respect to land and investment constraints has not been systematically investigated. Here, we compared conventional soil-based farming, vertical farming with natural lighting (Vnat), and indoor vertical farming. This study aimed to compare (1) the dynamic production of leafy vegetables over time given the same amount of investment and land constraints, (2) the associated water and energy use, and (3) the global warming potential (GWP) of the urban farming sector if each of the three farming systems was solely used in the tropical city-state of Singapore. A system dynamics (SD) model was constructed to map the potential quantity of leafy vegetables produced, together with the water and energy use of each farming system. The land and monetary investment constraints were set at an additional 0.3% of the total land area of Singapore and an annual investment of SGD 10-20 million (0.001-0.005% of Singapore's annual GDP). Vnat farming was predicted to have the highest production level (110,000 t) and self-sufficiency (76.9% of total demand) by 2050 based on the SD model. This would be 3 times the self-sufficiency level achieved by indoor and soil-based farming systems given the same investment and land constraints. Indoor farming was simulated to use <14% the land area of Vnat while soil-based farming exhausted the additional 0.3% of the land allocated. Indoor farming was also the most energy intensive system, requiring 100 times more than Vnat farming. Comparison of the GHG emission rates showed that indoor farming had the greatest GWP-at 2.51 kg CO(2)(-)eq per kg of lettuce produced. Our results suggest that Vnat farming may be the best form of urban farming system to provide large amounts of food in Singapore, considering the production level, the amount of resources used, and the environmental impacts.

AB  - Light quality exerts considerable effects on crop development and phytochemical content. Moreover, crops grown as microgreens are ideal for plant factories with artificial lighting, since they contain greater amounts of bioactive compounds compared to fully-grown plants. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of broad-spectra light with different red/blue ratios on the yield, morphology, and phytochemical content of seven microgreens. Mustard, radish, green basil, red amaranth, garlic chives, borage, and pea shoots were grown in a vertical farming system under three light sources emitting red/blue ratios of about 2, 5, and 9 units (RB2, RB5, and RB9, respectively). Mustard exhibited the most profound color responses. The yield was enhanced in three microgreens under RB9 and in garlic under RB2. Both the hypocotyl length and the leaf and cotyledon area were significantly enhanced by increasing the red light in three microgreens each. Total soluble solids (Brix) were reduced in 4 microgreens under RB2. The total phenolic content and antioxidant capacity were reduced under RB2 in 6 and 5 microgreens, respectively. The chlorophylls were variably affected but total the carotenoid content was reduced in RB9 in three microgreens. Overall, light wavelength differentially affected the microgreens' quality, while small interplays in spectral bands enhanced their phytochemical content.

AB  - To ensure food security, agricultural production systems should innovate in the direction of increasing production while reducing utilized resources. Due to the higher level of automation with respect to traditional agricultural systems, Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA) applications generally achieve better yields and quality crops at the expenses of higher energy consumption. In this context, Digital Twin (DT) may constitute a fundamental tool to reach the optimization of the productivity, intended as the ratio between production and resource consumption. For this reason, a DT Architecture for CEA systems is introduced within this work and applied to a case study for its validation. The proposed architecture is potentially able to optimize productivity since it utilizes simulation software that enables the optimization of: (i) Climate control strategies related to the control of the crop microclimate; (ii) treatments related to crop management. Due to the importance of food security in the worldwide landscape, the authors hope that this work may impulse the investigation of strategies for improving the productivity of CEA systems.

AB  - Automatic transport can improve the operational efficiency in plant factory production and reduce the use of labor. However, a determination of a plant factory automation operation mode should comprehensively consider the economic strength of the enterprise, operation objects and operation mode, production scale, technical strength, labor costs, and other factors. In this study, a logistics transport system comprising a set of cultivation units was developed for plant factories, using a mode based on shelf-end delivery without power inside the shelf. Moreover, an analysis was conducted on four modes of common transportation methods for the cultivation units for vertical cultivation in plant factories. The results showed that, when comparing the progressive transport type and warehousing/reciprocating transport type for cultivation units, the transport productivity of the former is higher than that of the latter, and the difference in the two transport productivities is proportional to the capacity for cultivation units in each layer. When the capacities for cultivation units in each layer are 20 and 40, the transport productivity of the former is 115-200% and 130-250% higher than that of the latter, respectively. Moreover, the logistics transport system developed herein reaches an input (output) transport productivity of 330 (270) cultivation units h(-1).</p>

AB  - High-temperature stress is a major risk to fresh-market Salvia production, and heat intolerance is a major constraint in sage cultivation, particularly during the hot summer season. Previously, we investigated heat tolerance in five common-market cultivars of sage plants using leaf relative injury (RI) values and found that S. elegans Vahl (SE) and S. officinalis L. (SO) were the most and least heat-tolerant species, respectively. The exogenous applications of salicylic acid (SA) and calcium chloride (CaCl2) to alleviate heat stress in various species have been extensively studied, but reports of the effects of SA and CaCl2 treatments on the heat tolerance of sage plants are scarce. The objective of this study was to investigate how SA and CaCl2 affect the physiology and morphology of SE and SO plants under high-temperature conditions. Potted plants were pretreated with SA (0, 100, 200, 400, and 800 mu M) and CaCl2 (0, 5, 10, and 15 mM), alone and combined, exposed to 55 degrees C and 80% humidity for 30 min, then placed in an environment-controlled chamber at 30 degrees C for three days and evaluated for changes in phenotypic appearance, RI, spectral reflectance, and chlorophyll fluorescence indices at different time intervals. Plants watered without chemical solutions were used as controls. Our results show that the growth of SO plants pretreated with SA and CaCl2 was more robust, compared with control plants, which were considerably affected by heat stress, resulting in brown, withered leaves and defoliation. The effects of the combined applications of SA (100 mu M) and CaCl2 (5 mM) to SO plants were superior to control plants in increasing values of soil-plant analysis development (SPAD), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and the maximal quantum yield of photosystemII photochemistry (Fv/Fm), while reducing RI%. Furthermore, SO plants exhibited higher SPAD and Fv/Fm values and lower RI% than SE plants in combined treatments at all time intervals after heat stress, implying that different genotypes displayed variations in their SPAD, Fv/Fm, and RI%. Thus, a combined treatment of 100 mu M of SA and 5 mM of CaCl2 is effective and beneficial to plant appearance and ability to ameliorate heat stress. These indices can be used as indicators to characterize the physiology of these plants and applied on a commercial scale for informing the development of rapid and precise management practices on bedded sage plants grown in plant factories to achieve maximum market benefit.

AB  - Controlled environment agriculture (CEA) technologies are required to meet current and future food production demand as the global population rises, arable land decreases, and minerals for fertilizer production are depleted. Hydroponics and recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) are intensive production methods that can provide season-independent vegetables and seafood in urban settings but are limited by a reliance on fertilizing solutions made from finite mineral reserves and the treatment and disposal costs of nutrient rich effluent, respectively. The development of a capture and reuse system where RAS effluent is solubilized to become plant-available and utilized as a hydroponic nutrient solution would aid both industries and increase food security in urban food deserts. Aerobic mineralization is used in domestic wastewater treatment to reduce solid content and solubilize particulate-bound nutrients. Preliminary studies have also shown that aerobic mineralization can be an effective method for RAS effluent treatment. Aerobic batch reactors were used to mineralize RAS effluent in this study. Suspended solids reduction achieved in the reactors was measured throughout the experiment and the plant-availability of twelve nutrients was determined before and after treatment. It was shown that aerobic mineralization can effectively reduce particulate-bound solids and solubilize nutrients to increase plant utilization in RAS effluent.</p>

AB  - The article focuses on the energy demand optimisation of indoor vertical farms (IVFs) with artificial lighting using load shifting. The solution in agriculture of IVFs attracts interest; however, operating them without a plan is costly and inefficient. In this research, it was experimentally proven that by electricity load shifting on IVFs, it can result in a 16-26% reduction of artificial lighting costs for all months throughout the year, by simply selecting the times of the day that the required darkness will be provided to the plants (in this experiment, basil). Therefore, one could understand that mass deployment of IVFs within cities could minimise the operational costs, decrease CO2 emissions-since for a large number of leafy products the production will take place in cities - and increase the number of agriculture-based jobs offered in the urban environment. Cash flow analysis of various scenarios revealed that possible investors in indoor vertical farms, in most of the cases, have a full payback period of their investment amount in less than 9 years, while in the majority of the cases the repayment period is as low as 2 years.

AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is the total amount of water lost from evaporation and transpiration via plant growing media and plant surfaces. ET models have been widely researched for outdoor plants, forests, and wetlands. However, studies on ET models for controlled environment agriculture (CEA) are limited. Reliable predictions of ET in CEA are essential for quantifying the performance of CEA systems. This review focused on evaluating the twelve existing ET models that have been used for indoor ET estimation. Also, we provided an overview of the key parameters that affect ET in existing ET models and different calibration methods for ET models. We summarized existing studies on crop coefficient and stomatal conductance and reviewed case studies that utilized ET models for different CEA applications. We identified research gaps in ET modeling and highlighted research needs for ET parameter interdependence, validation of existing models for indoor farming, and a comprehensive crop resistance model.

AB  - Since plants with a high biomass conversion efficiency of light energy consume less energy and require shorter cultivation periods, it is expected that plant factories can have more output with less energy. However, there have been few studies on the biomass conversion efficiency of light energy in various cultivated plants, and this agricultural engineering field is still unexplored. If the amount of energy consumed by a plant factory can be obtained from the biomass conversion efficiency of light energy, the plant types that can be grown in a plant factory and the economic efficiency of the plant factory can be clarified. In this study, we determined the amount of light energy required for plant cultivation by measuring the wavelength distribution of sunlight and plantgrowing light-emitting diodes. Also, we investigated the light to biomass conversion efficiency from the amount of heat generated by the biomass of cultivated plants. The light to biomass conversion efficiency was also used to analyze the payback period of plant factories so as to estimate the profitability of various cultivated plants. The solar to biomass conversion efficiency of the tested leafy vegetables ranged from 0.03% to 0.62%, while the efficiency of the cultivation LEDs ranged from 1.21% to 20.1%. The conversion efficiency including the energy consumption of air conditioning ranged from 0.13 to 5.7%. By measuring the biomass conversion efficiency of plants, it is possible to analyze the profitability of plant factories with a high degree of accuracy.

AB  - Specialized metabolites from plants are important for human health due to their antioxidant properties. Light is one of the main factors modulating the biosynthesis of specialized metabolites, determining the cascade response activated by photoreceptors and the consequent modulation of expressed genes and biosynthetic pathways. Recent developments in light emitting diode (LED) technology have enabled improvements in artificial light applications for horticulture. In particular, the possibility to select specific spectral light compositions, intensities and photoperiods has been associated with altered metabolite content in a variety of crops. This review aims to analyze the effects of indoor LED lighting recipes and management on the specialized metabolite content in different groups of crop plants (namely medicinal and aromatic plants, microgreens and edible flowers), focusing on the literature from the last 5 years. The literature collection produced a total of 40 papers, which were analyzed according to the effects of artificial LED lighting on the content of anthocyanins, carotenoids, phenols, tocopherols, glycosides, and terpenes, and ranked on a scale of 1 to 3. Most studies applied a combination of red and blue light (22%) or monochromatic blue (23%), with a 16 h day(-1) photoperiod (78%) and an intensity greater than 200 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) (77%). These treatment features were often the most efficient in enhancing specialized metabolite content, although large variations in performance were observed, according to the species considered and the compound analyzed. The review aims to provide valuable indications for the definition of the most promising spectral components toward the achievement of nutrient-rich indoor-grown products. (c) 2021 The Authors.

AB  - The color and nutritional quality of vegetables directly affect the choices of consumers and thus affect the commercial value of the vegetable products. Green light can penetrate the outer leaves and reach the inner leaves to promote photochemical reaction of the overlapping leaves of head vegetables. However, whether this promotion can increase the nutritional components and change the color of the inner leaves of head cabbages, which is one of the major head vegetables largely produced worldwide, remains unclear. Therefore, we investigated the changes in the colors and the concentrations of chlorophyll (Chl) and carotenoid of the inner leaves of two types of cabbages by externally irradiating the cabbage with green light. The results showed that a short-term (48 h) irradiation with low light intensity (50 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) of green light enhanced the Chl concentration and colors of the inner leaves of cabbages, and the positive changes of these indicators increased as the leaf layers approached the head center of the cabbage. Simultaneously, we also establish a method to effectively estimate the Chl concentration using luminosity (L*) and greenness (- a*) when the Chl concentration is so low that it is difficult or not possible to be measured by SPAD meter. Our findings demonstrated that green light, as a new tool, can be used to control the colors and nutritional components of the inner leaves of cabbages. The discoveries will help produce head vegetables with the preferred phenotype desired by consumers using a plant factory with artificial lighting.

AB  - Agriculture is the basic necessity all over the world which provides food for the existence of humans. India is expected to be home to 1.6 billion people by 2050, and India has to double the food production from the current level of 260 MT to feed the entire population. Providing food for growing population is becoming tedious and the deficiency of fertile lands makes it more difficult to increase the production beyond a certain limit. Under such scenario, maximizing the production per unit area using precision technologies in agriculture will help to achieve the same. Smart technologies are getting attention in every domain by the inclusion of advanced technologies like Big data analytics, Robotics, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT) etc. This article reviews the current literature published in the stream controlled environment agriculture like soil less hydroponics, aquaponics, nutrient film technique and aeroponics for the period of 1999-2020. In this article, different types of soilless agriculture, their advantages over traditional soil methods, different types of sensors employed in agriculture, implementation of recent precision technologies in soilless agriculture are discussed. The review suggests that "smart farming" is an emerging trend in the area of agriculture, which makes, every individual to practice farming and grow vegetables and fruits on their own in their house without soil. However, future research ideas should focus on areas of "real time monitoring of nutrition solution management and pest management" for the plants growing in controlled environment to maximize the production are also discussed.

AB  - Hydroponic lettuce has been widely cultivated in plant factory and desiring for mechanical harvesting and packing. Sorting of hydroponic lettuce must be carried out before packing. Information perception and image processing of hydroponic lettuce is a crucial technology to develop a robotic sorting system. In this study, DeepLabV3+ models of deep learning technologies were employed with four backbones of ResNet-50, ResNet101, Xception-65, and Xception-71 to design a vision system of segmenting abnormal leaves (yellow, withered, and decay leaves) of hydroponic lettuce. Two weights assignation methods, i.e., median frequency weights (MFW) and uniform weights (UW), were incorporated into DeepLabV3+ and compared for performance. Results showed that models trained by UW were better than that of MFW assignation method. ResNet-101 had the best segmentation performance in UW assignation method with pixel accuracy of 99.24% and mIoU of 0.8326. In terms of speed, ResNet-50 had the fast segmentation speeds with 154.0 ms per image. This study provided object detection methodology for automatic sorting device of hydroponic lettuce.

AB  - The recent COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the value of technologies that allow a fast setup and production of biopharmaceuticals in emergency situations. The plant factory system can provide a fast response to epidemics/pandemics. Thanks to their scalability and genome plasticity, plants represent advantageous platforms to produce vaccines. Plant systems imply less complicated production processes and quality controls with respect to mammalian and bacterial cells. The expression of vaccines in plants is based on transient or stable transformation systems and the recent progresses in genome editing techniques, based on the CRISPR/Cas method, allow the manipulation of DNA in an efficient, fast, and easy way by introducing specific modifications in specific sites of a genome. Nonetheless, CRISPR/Cas is far away from being fully exploited for vaccine expression in plants. In this review, an overview of the potential conjugation of the renewed vaccine technologies (i.e., virus-like particles-VLPs, and industrialization of the production process) with genome editing to produce vaccines in plants is reported, illustrating the potential advantages in the standardization of the plant platforms, with the overtaking of constancy of large-scale production challenges, facilitating regulatory requirements and expediting the release and commercialization of the vaccine products of genome edited plants.

AB  - The main aim of the article is to find out the key factors of sustainable development of the Russian Arctic, which is strategically significant for Russia. The academic literature was reviewed to find out the time dynamics of the references to the economic models suitable for achieving the goals of sustainable development, and there has been hyperbolic growth in the attention paid to similar problems all around the world. The article compares three relatively new economic models in order to understand which of them is the most applicable to the promotion of sustainable development in the Russian Arctic: (a) bioeconomy, (b) green economy and (c) circular economy. The analysis of the relevant sources shows that the model of the circular economy is preferable for the Russian Arctic. Most of the article is dedicated to understanding the sources and mechanisms of the circular economy. The schematic description of vertical greenhouses and possibility of using vertical farms are presented in the paper as an example of organization of local food production according to the principles of the circular economy. The article considers a modeled project of creating a vertical farm in the Russian Arctic and a simulated indicator-profit of the vertical farm.

AB  - Lighting is a major component of energy consumption in controlled environment agriculture (CEA) operations. Skyscraper farms (multilevel production in buildings with transparent glazing) have been proposed as alternatives to greenhouse or plant factories (opaque warehouses) to increase space-use efficiency while accessing some natural light. However, there are no previous models on natural light availability and distribution in skyscraper farms. This study employed climate-based daylight modeling software and the Typical Meteorological Year (TMY) dataset to investigate the effects of building geometry and context shading on the availability and spatial distribution of natural light in skyscraper farms in Los Angeles (LA) and New York City (NYC). Electric energy consumption for supplemental lighting in 20-storey skyscraper farms to reach a daily light integral target was calculated using simulation results. Natural lighting in our baseline skyscraper farms without surrounding buildings provides 13% and 15% of the light required to meet a target of 17 mol.m(-2).day(-1). More elongated buildings may meet up to 27% of the lighting requirements with natural light. However, shading from surrounding buildings can reduce available natural light considerably; in the worst case, natural light only supplies 5% of the lighting requirements. Overall, skyscraper farms require between 4 to 11 times more input for lighting than greenhouses per crop canopy area in the same location. We conclude that the accessibility of natural light in skyscraper farms in dense urban settings provides little advantage over plant factories.

AB  - To investigate the effects of supplementary UV-A intensity on growth and antioxidant compounds in Chinese kale (Brassica alboglabra Bailey) baby-leaves, three different UV-A intensity treatments (5, 10, 15 W center dot m(-)(2), respectively) were applied 10 days before harvest in artificial light plant factory. In Chinese kale baby-leaves, supplemental 5 and 10 W center dot m(-2) UV-A (UVA-5 and UVA-10) were beneficial for inter-node length, stem diameter, canopy diameter, fresh weight and dry weight, particularly in UVA-10 treatment, while these above-mentioned growth parameters all significantly decreased in UVA-15 treatment. The soluble sugar content decreased under UVA-5, but there was no significant difference under UVA-10 and UVA-15. Soluble protein contents decreased under UVA-5 and UVA-10, but significantly increased under UVA-15. UVA-10 played a predominant role in increasing FRAP and contents of total phenolics and total flavonoids compared to other treatments. Contents of total glucosinolates (GLs), aliphatic GLs and indolic GLs in Chinese kale baby-leaves significantly increased with UV-A intensity increasing, and the highest contents were found under UVA-15. The percentage of total aliphatic GLs (about 80%) was significantly higher than those of total indolic GLs. Glucobrassicanapin and sinigrin were two major individual GLs in Chinese kale baby-leaves, variation trends of which were consistent with the contents of total GLs and aliphatic GLs. From the heatmap analysis, and taking economic benefits into account, UVA-10 might be optimal for the production of high-quality Chinese kale baby-leaves in an artificial light plant factory.

AB  - During the past few decades, vertical farming has attracted a lot of interest as an alternative food production method. Vertical farms use engineered growth environments and hydroponic cultivation techniques for growing plants indoors. One of the important factors in vertical farming for the cultivation of different plants is the amount of nutrients, which can be measured as electrical conductivity (EC). Studying the optimal EC is important for avoiding nutrient loss and deficiency in vertical farms. In this study, we investigated the effect of five EC levels (2, 1.2, 0.9, 0.7, and 0.5 dS m(-1)) of Hoagland nutrient solution on the growth and development of basil cultivar 'Emily' and lettuce cultivar 'Batavia-Caipira'. During the study, the environmental parameters were kept fixed using an automatic dosing machine. The experiment was done in automatic vertical farms using the hydroponic ebb-flow cultivation technique with a temperature of 20 +/- 1 degrees C, relative humidity of 50-60%, CO2 concentration of 450 ppm, pH = 6, the PPFD (photosynthetic photon flux density) of 215 +/- 5.5 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), and the photoperiod of 16:8 h (day/night). Each treatment was replicated four times. We studied the effects on several growth parameters (including the dry and fresh weight of leaves and roots, number of leaves, and leaf area) as well as the chlorophyll and nitrogen concentration of the leaves. According to the results, the basil and lettuce growth parameters among the five treatments have been significantly higher in the treatment with EC of 1.2 and 0.9 dS m(-1). These EC values are lower than the recommended EC value given as the optimum in the previous studies. However, the concentration of chlorophyll and nitrogen show different trends and were higher in full strength of nutrient solution with EC = 2 dS m(-1).

AB  - Basil suffers from chilling injury (CI) when stored at temperatures below 10-12 degrees C which seems related to the imbalance between reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidants. We hypothesized that increased light intensity applied shortly before harvest (EOP, End-Of-Production) increases nutritional value i.e. carbohydrates and antioxidants and could improve the chilling tolerance. Two basil cultivars were grown in a vertical farming set-up at a light intensity of 150 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). During the last 5 days of growth, EOP light treatments ranging from 50 to 600 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) were applied. After harvest the leaves were stored at 4 or 12 degrees C in darkness. Higher EOP light intensity increased the antioxidant (total ascorbic acid, rosmarinic acid) and carbohydrate contents at harvest. During storage antioxidants decreased more rapidly at 4 than at 12 degrees C. However, increased EOP light intensity did not alleviate chilling symptoms suggesting a minor role of antioxidants studied against chilling stress.

AB  - This study was conducted to compare the effects of broad spectrum during the whole seedling period and photon flux density (PFD) in the healing stage on the growth and energy use efficiency of grafted tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) transplants in a plant factory. Fluorescent lights, white LED lights, and white plus red LED lights were applied at the growth processes of grafted tomato transplants from germination of rootstock and scion to post-grafting. Three levels of PFD (50, 100, 150 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) were set in the healing stage under each kind of light quality. The results indicated that the growth and quality of grafted tomato transplants under different broad spectrums were influenced by the ratio of red to blue light (R/B ratio) and the ratio of red to far-red light (R/FR ratio). A higher R/B ratio was beneficial to total dry matter accumulation, but excessive red light had a negative effect on the root to shoot ratio and the seedling quality index. The higher blue light and R/FR ratio suppressed stem extension synergistically. The LED lights had good abilities to promote plant compactness and leaf thickness in comparison with fluorescent lights. The plant compactness and leaf thickness increased with the increase in daily light integral in the healing stage within a range from 2.5 to 7.5 mol m(-2) d(-1) (PFD, 50 to 150 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)). Compared to fluorescent lights, the LED lights showed more than 110% electrical energy saving for lighting during the whole seedling period. Higher PFD in the healing stage did not significantly increase the consumption of electric power for lighting. White plus red LED lights with an R/B ratio of 1.2 and R/FR ratio of 16 were suggested to replace fluorescent lights for grafted tomato transplants production considering the high quality of transplants and electrical energy saving, and PFD in the healing stage was recommended to be set to 150 mu mol m(-2) s(-1).

AB  - In recent years, new forms of high-tech controlled environment agriculture (CEA) have received increased attention and investment. These systems integrate a suite of technologies - including automation, LED lighting, vertical plant stacking, and hydroponic fertilization - to allow for greater control of temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide, oxygen, and light in an enclosed growing environment. Proponents insist that CEA can produce sustainable, nutritious, and tasty local food, particularly for the cities of the future. At the same time, a variety of critics raise concerns about its environmental impacts and energy use, high startup costs, and consumer accessibility challenges, among other issues. At this stage, however, relatively little research has explored actual consumer knowledge and attitudes related to CEA processes and products. Guided by theories of sense-making, this article draws from structured interviews with local food consumers in New York City to examine what people know and think about high-tech CEA. From there, it explores the extent to which CEA fits into consumer conceptualizations of what makes for "good food." Key findings emphasize that significant gaps in public understanding of CEA remain, that CEA products' success will depend on the ability of the industry to deliver on its environmental promises, and that concerns about "unnatural" aspects of CEA will need to be allayed. Given the price premium at which high-tech CEA products are currently sold, the industry's expansion will depend in large part on its ability to convince value-oriented food consumers that the products meet the triple-bottom-line of economic, social, and environmental sustainability goals.

AB  - Basil (Ocimum basilicum L.) is a popular crop worldwide among farmers; it is relatively easy to grow and is well adapted to hydroponic and Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA) systems having a high profitability margin. Several studies investigated the effect of the environmental factors on the qualitative and quantitative factors of basil: the effect of light is crucial for development, nutritional properties and sensory characteristics. The principles of sustainability, profitability and resource-effectiveness all encourages farmers to use energy-efficient LED light sources. These tools easily allow for the modification of spectral distribution and light intensity; numerous suggestions have been made for developing goal-driven light recipes for maximum cost-effectiveness and for reducing carbon footprint. Here, the results of several studies are summarized for providing a solid base for light recipe utilization of basil production in terms of light intensity, duration, and spectral distribution. Experimental results related to the impact of light treatments on vegetative parameters, phytonutrient content and sensory properties of basil are discussed, and optimal ranges of light parameters are summarized. Due to the increasing number of promising specialized research the wider application of purposedriven high-tech production systems is expected in future basil growing.

AB  - In this article, we share our experience in the scope of controlled-environment agriculture automation in the Antarctic station greenhouse facility called EDEN ISS. For remote plant monitoring, control, and maintenance, we solve the problem of plant classification. Due to the inherent communication limitations between Antarctica and Europe, we first propose the image compression mechanism for the data collection. We show that we can compress the images, on average, 7.2 times for efficient transmission over the weak channel. Moreover, we prove that decompressed images can be further used for computer vision applications. Upon decompressing images, we apply machine learning for the classification task. We achieve 92.6% accuracy on an 18-classes unbalanced dataset. The proposed approach is promising for a number of agriculture related applications, including the plant classification, identification of plant diseases, and deviation of plant phenology.

AB  - As natural agroecology deteriorates, controlled environment agriculture (CEA) systems become the backup support for coping with future resource consumption and potential food crises. Compared with natural agroecology, most of the environmental parameters of the CEA system rely on manual management. Such a system is dependent and fragile and prone to degradation, which includes harmful bacteria proliferation and productivity decline. Proper water management is significant for constructing a stabilized rhizosphere microenvironment. It has been proved that water is an efficient tool for changing the availability of nutrients, plant physiological processes, and microbial communities within. However, for CEA issues, relevant research is lacking at present. The article reviews the interactive mechanism between water management and rhizosphere microenvironments from the perspectives of physicochemical properties, physiological processes, and microbiology in CEA systems. We presented a synthesis of relevant research on water-root-microbes interplay, which aimed to provide detailed references to the conceptualization, research, diagnosis, and troubleshooting for CEA systems, and attempted to give suggestions for the construction of a high-tech artificial agricultural ecology.

AB  - In plant factories, the plant microclimate is affected by the control system, plant physiological activities and aerodynamic characteristics of leaves, which often leads to poor ventilation uniformity, suboptimal environmental conditions and inefficient air conditioning. In this study, interlayer cool airflow (ILCA) was used to introduce room air into plants' internal canopy through vent holes in cultivation boards and air layer between cultivation boards and nutrient solution surface (interlayer). By using optimal operating parameters at a room temperature of 28 degrees C, the ILCA system achieved similar cooling effects in the absence of a conventional air conditioning system and achieved an energy saving of 50.8% while bringing about positive microclimate change in the interlayer and nutrient solution. This resulted in significantly reduced root growth by 41.7% without a negative influence on lettuce crop yield. Future development in this precise microclimate control method is predicted to replace the conventional cooling (air conditioning) systems for crop production in plant factories.

AB  - Addition of selenium or application of ultraviolet A (UVA) radiation for crop production could be an effective way of producing phytochemical-rich food. This study was conducted to investigate the effects of selenium and UVA radiation, as well as their combination on growth and phytochemical contents in broccoli microgreens. There were three treatments: Se (100 mu mol/L Na2SeO3), UVA (40 mu mol/m(2)/s) and Se + UVA (with application of Se and UVA). The control (CK) was Se spraying-free and UVA radiation-free. Although treatment with Se or/and UVA inhibited plant growth of broccoli microgreens, results showed that phytochemical contents increased. Broccoli microgreens under the Se treatment had higher contents of total soluble sugars, total phenolic compounds, total flavonoids, ascorbic acid, Fe, and organic Se and had lower Zn content. The UVA treatment increased the contents of total chlorophylls, total soluble proteins, total phenolic compounds, and FRAP. However, the Se + UVA treatment displayed the most remarkable effect on the contents of total anthocyanins, glucoraphanin, total aliphatic glucosinolates, and total glucosinolates; here, significant interactions between Se and UVA were observed. This study provides valuable insights into the combinational selenium and UVA for improving the phytochemicals of microgreens grown in an artificial lighting plant factory.

AB  - Advanced technology in agriculture has enabled the manipulation of the artificial light spectrum in plant development such as improving yield and plant growth. Light manipulation using light-emitting diodes or LEDs can inhibit, delay, or even promote flowering. Some studies have shown that far-red (FR) light can stop flowering, but studies have not fully explored the best method involving intensity and duration to induce plant growth. This paper presents results on LED light manipulation techniques, particularly FR light, on plant flowering control and plant elongation. The light manipulation technique on the combination of colors, photoperiods, and intensities proved that it can stop flowering, and stimulate and control the growth of plants during cultivation. The system was monitored using an Internet-of-Things (IoT) remote monitoring system, and it performed data mining. The results showed that plants that were grown under artificial sunlight (T5) and normal light (T1) treatments were superior compared to others. The FR light delayed flowering until 50 days of planting and accelerated the plant growth and increased the fresh weight by 126%. The experiment showed that a high variable intensity at 300 mu mol m(-1)s(-1) showed a great performance and produced the largest leaf area of 1517.0 cm(2) and the highest fresh weight of 492.92 g. This study provides new insights to the researchers and the farming community on artificial light systems in improving plant factory production efficiency and in determining the best plant cultivation approach to create a stronger indoor farming management plant.

AB  - Recent advancements in light-emitting diode technology provide an opportunity to evaluate the correlation between different light sources and plant growth as well as their secondary metabolites. The aim of this study was to determine the optimal light intensity and photoperiod for increasing plant growth and glucosinolate concentration and content in watercress. Two-week-old seedlings were transplanted in a semi-deep flow technique system of a plant factory for 28 days under four photoperiod-light intensity treatments (12 h-266 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1), 16 h-200 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1), 20 h-160 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1), and 24 h-133 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1)) with the same daily light integral. The mean values of shoot fresh and dry weights were the highest under the 20 h-160 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1) treatment, although there was no significant difference. Net photosynthesis and stomatal conductance gradually decreased with decreasing light intensity and increasing photoperiod. However, total glucosinolate concentration was significantly higher under 20 h-160 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1) and 24 h-133 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1) compared with 12 h-266 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1) and 16 h-200 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1). The total glucosinolate content was the greatest under 20 h-160 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1) treatment. These data suggest that the 20 h-160 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1) treatment promoted the maximum shoot biomass and glucosinolate content in watercress. This study supplies the optimal light strategies for the future industrial large-watercress cultivation.

AB  - This paper proposed a light-emitting diode (LED) automatic lighting system for plant factories. This system can achieve the simultaneous effects of automatic dimming and seven-segment mixing; the light intensity and color can therefore be adjusted according to the properties of the plants to increase crop harvest. The operation method comprises detection of the light source through a photosensitive diode CdS, and sending the analog value obtained from the light intensity to the single chip dsPIC30F4011 for analog-to-digital conversion. This single chip stores the digital value in the internal pulse width modulation (PWM) register and outputs it to the dimming circuit to achieve the effect of automatic dimming. In addition, the operator can also connect to the system using smartphone Bluetooth and an ATmega328 single chip and manually select the color of the light source through the human-machine interface. The ATmega328 chip receives the operating signal and transfers it to the dsPIC30F4011, which automatically changes the PWM output channel to achieve seven-segment light mixing.

AB  - Plant factories have developed within urban contexts following efforts to expand local food production, create local jobs, and provide alternatives to conventional agriculture with lower greenhouse gas emissions. One plant factory system, container farms, consists of artificially lit, vertically stacked hydroponic farms inside retrofitted shipping containers and support crop production in otherwise unused locations regardless of climate and daylight availability. Given their high energy intensity, municipalities considering container farms require reliable models to study their overall environmental performance and feasibility. While previous studies have used co-simulators to consider plant-air interactions within building performance simulation (BPS) tools, energy validation studies are lacking for such models. This research presents the validation of an EnergyPlus model of a hydroponic container farm in Boston, Massachusetts based on nine months of measured data. Despite shortcomings in predicting of hourly conditioning energy, the resulting calibrated energy model achieves a Normalized Mean Bias Error of 3% and a Coefficient of Variation of the Root-Mean-Square Error of 11%. Results show that through representing plant-air interactions within EnergyPlus and modeling cooling coefficient of performance as a function of outdoor air temperature, stakeholders can reliably predict annual container farm energy use.

AB  - Published work indicates that high percentage of blue light can enhance pigment levels but decreases growth, while addition of far-red light to growth light can increase quantum efficiency and photosynthesis in leafy greens. Combining high-energy blue light with low-energy far-red light may increase both vegetative growth and pigment levels. However, the effect of high-energy blue and low-energy far-red light on the vegetative growth and pigments synthesis is unclear. This information can be potentially useful for enhancing the levels of pigments with nutritional value (e.g., beta-carotene and anthocyanins) in the produce grown in vertical farms. We grew romaine lettuce (cv. Amadeus) under similar light intensity (approximately 130 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1)) but different proportions of red: blue: far-red including 90:10: 0 ("High-R"), 50: 50: 0 ("High-B"), and 42: 42: 16 ("High-B+FR") for 31 days. Results indicated that canopy area and leaf photosynthetic rate of lettuce plants was reduced in the High-B, thereby reducing plant growth. We did not observe photosynthesis enhancement in the High-B+FR. Instead, plants clearly showed photomorphogenic effects. The phytochrome photostationary state (PSS) decreased with far-red addition, resulting in reduced leaf number per plant. This was likely to shift the allocation of resources toward elongation growth for shade avoidance. Further, we observed an increase in the area of individual leaves, canopy area, and shoot dry weight in the High-B+FR. However, these appear to be an indirect consequence of decreased leaf number per plant. Our results also indicate that changes in expansion growth at individual leaf scale largely regulated pigment concentration in plants. As individual leaf area became smaller (e.g., High-B) or larger (e.g., High-B+FR), the levels of pigments including chlorophylls and beta-carotene increased or decreased, respectively. Area of individual leaves also positively influenced canopy area (and likely light interception) and shoots dry weight (or vegetative growth). Our study provides additional insights into the effects of high-energy blue and low-energy far-red light on individual leaf number and leaf growth, which appear to control plant growth and pigment levels in lettuce.

AB  - UV-B (280-315 nm) radiation has been used as an effective tool to improve bioactive compound contents in controlled environments, such as plant factories. However, plant structure changes with growth progress induce different positional distributions of UV-B radiation interception, which cause difficulty in accurately evaluating the effects of UV-B on biosynthesis of bioactive compounds. The objective of this study was to quantitatively analyze the positional distributions of UV-B radiation interception and bioactive compound contents of kales (Brassica oleracea L. var. acephala) with growth progress and their relationships. Short-term moderate UV-B levels did not affect the plant growth and photosynthetic parameters. Spatial UV-B radiation interception was analyzed quantitatively by using 3D-scanned plant models and ray-tracing simulations. As growth progressed, the differences in absorbed UV-B energy between leaf positions were more pronounced. The concentrations of total phenolic compound (TPC) and total flavonoid compound (TFC) were higher with more cumulative absorbed UV-B energy. The cumulative UV energy yields for TFC were highest for the upper leaves of the older plants, while those for TPC were highest in the middle leaves of the younger plants. Despite the same UV-B levels, the UV-B radiation interception and UV-B susceptibility in the plants varied with leaf position and growth stage, which induced the different biosynthesis of TFC and TPC. This attempt to quantify the relationship between UV-B radiation interception and bioactive compound contents will contribute to the estimation and production of bioactive compounds in plant factories.

AB  - In recent years, edible insects, lab-grown meat, and vertically farmed produce have been praised as potential sustainable food alternatives to the increasingly unsustainable Western diet. Although these sustainable food alternatives offer considerable benefits, consumers typically reject them without much consideration. When prompted to explain their rejection, consumers often report specific concerns regarding these foods. Edible insects, for instance, are argued to carry "diseases," lab-grown meat is seen as "unhealthy," and vertically farmed produce is perceived to be "less natural." Addressing these self-reported concerns has, however, proven insufficient in fully overcoming consumers' rejection. The results of the three empirical studies presented in this manuscript offer a new explanation as to why. Specifically, we argue that consumers' self-reported concerns regarding sustainable food alternatives may not per se convey the root cause of their rejection. Instead, we argue that people may also report such concerns as the result of an underlying problem: sustainable food alternatives may elicit disgust because they typically deviate from what consumers have internalized to be normal food, causing consumers to intuitively reject them. Importantly, in an attempt to appear rational, disgusted consumers may consequently rationalize their intuitive rejection with seemingly reasonable concerns, such as "insects carry diseases." Rather than exclusively addressing consumers' self-reported concerns, our results suggest that marketers seeking to promote sustainable food alternatives should consider a subtle, less mentioned cause of consumers' rejection: the perception that these foods deviate from people's internalized norms.

AB  - Ethylene is not only well known as a unique gaseous hormone, which has various impacts on plant growth, but also considered to be closely related to tomato productivity and occurrence of fruit physiological disorders. On the other hand, the different tomato cultivars were also considered as key factors influencing tomato productivity and quality. In this study, we examined the differences between ethylene emission characteristics of different tomato cultivars. Our results confirmed that the Dutch tomato cultivar 'Endeavour' emitted less ethylene compared to other Japanese tomato cultivars, whereas ethylene emission in 'Rinnka409' was significantly higher than that in other cultivars. We observed that the wounding treatment resulted in rapid increase in ethylene emission in tomato, and the increase in ethylene emission was much higher in the 'Momotarou Youku' cultivar than that in the 'Endeavour' cultivar. The results will be useful to maximize tomato productivity and reduce the occurrence of fruit physiological disorders in tomato production at plant factories.

AB  - In recent years, the efficiency of combinatorial methods has been utilized to accelerate the finding or screening of inorganic materials. In this work, based on the double substitution strategy of the cation ions Me2+/Si4+, a series of MeyY3-yAl5-ySiyO12:Eu-x garnet phosphors (MeYASG:Eu, Me = Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba) were rapidly prepared and screened by a combinatorial method in microreactor arrays. Through parallel experiments of solid-state synthesis, the reliability of the combinatorial screening was verified and an optimal composition of CaY2Al4SiO12:Eu-0.03 (CYASG:Eu) with advanced luminous intensity was obtained. Annealing experiments under air and reductive atmospheres were performed and demonstrated the controllability and reversibility of the Eu3+ <-> Eu2+ valence transition process, thus realizing the tuning of the dominant emission from divalent Eu2+ or trivalent Eu3+. The optimal CYASG:Eu sample showed excellent thermal quenching resistance after annealing at 800 degrees C for 1 h in a reducing atmosphere. The abnormal intensity of PL increased by 10% in the 50-100 degrees C region, and retained 63% of the initial value at 250 degrees C. With the assistance of thermoluminescence characterization, the complementary effect of the release of captured electrons or charge carriers in trap levels on the abnormal increase of PL intensity during the high-temperature luminescence process was revealed. By combination of the double substitution strategy of cations and annealing, a new approach is proposed to creating the coexistence of activator Eu ions with a mixed-valence state. Also, the prepared CYASG:Eu phosphors have promising applications in fields such as plant light supplements in greenhouses and plant factories and as luminescent materials for energy-saving light sources.

AB  - The growth of plants and their glucosinolate content largely depend on the cultivation environment; however, there are limited reports on the optimization of ambient environmental factors for kale grown in plant factories. This study was conducted to investigate the effects of temperature, relative humidity, and the carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration on kale growth and glucosinolate content in different growth stages of cultivation in a plant factory. Kale was grown under different temperatures (14, 17, 20, 23, and 26 degrees C), relative humidities (45, 55, 65, 75, and 85%), and CO2 concentrations (400, 700, 1000, 1300, and 1600 ppm) in a plant factory. Two and four weeks after transplantation, leaf samples were collected to evaluate the physical growth and glucosinolate contents. The statistical significance of the treatment effects was determined by two-way analysis of variance, and Duncan's multiple range test was used to compare the means. A correlation matrix was constructed to show possible linear trends among the dependent variables. The observed optimal temperature, relative humidity, and CO2 range for growth (20-23 degrees C, 85%, and 700-1000 ppm) and total glucosinolate content (14-17 degrees C, 55-75%, and 1300-1600 ppm) were different. Furthermore, the glucosinolate content in kale decreased with the increase of temperature and relative humidity levels, and increased with the increase of CO2 concentration. Most of the physical growth variables showed strong positive correlations with each other but negative correlations with glucosinolate components. The findings of this study could be used by growers to maintain optimum environmental conditions for the better growth and production of glucosinolate-rich kale leaves in protected cultivation facilities.

AB  - Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) is critically required for sustaining plant and vegetable growth. This study investigated PAR availabilities in two typical large-scale greenhouses using an advanced method of climate-based solar modelling in China. Seven Chinese locations in terms of daylight (solar) climate zones and latitudes were studied. The PAR prediction was conducted via RADIANCE (ray-tracing solar and light simulation package). Key findings were: 1) A climate-based analysis was proved as more practical than the methods based on only clear sky and solar geometries. 2) A ray-tracing solar modelling could effectively predict PAR levels at specific positions (e.g. vertical planes), which could benefit the development of vertical farming activities. 3) The PAR availability could receive insignificant impact from roof configuration in these large-scale greenhouses. 4) For the approach of vertical farming, the vertical arrangement of planting system could be significantly affected by greenhouse orientations, while horizontally no such effect can be found. These findings could be developed into design strategies to support greenhouse planning.

AB  - Although optimal control has been used extensively for greenhouse climate management, its application to plant factories is still in its infancy. In this paper, profitability of growing lettuce in a Chinese plant factory is investigated by means of optimal control computations. To that end, first, a lettuce growth model is adapted to fit a plant factory environment. Next, this model is calibrated and validated using nine sets of experimental data with different LED light intensities. Using the calibrated and validated model, optimal control computations are used to produce a 3D plot revealing the influence of the electricity and lettuce price on maximum profit. Lettuce's physiological demand for dark periods during artificial lighting is incorporated by fixing this dark period to eight hours a day. Therefore, the optimal LED light intensity pattern obtained from the optimal control computations could be used in the actual production process. Maximum profit can reach 264.88 RMB m(-2) assuming a Chinese plant factory fresh lettuce price of 34.5 RMB kg(-1). When lettuce must be sold at 5.01 RMB kg(-1), which represents the price for an open field product, profit always comes out negative. Besides, LED lighting is not advised when the electricity price is greater than 0.84 RMB kWh(-1) under these circumstances. Profit is only positive when the lettuce price is over 20 RMB kg(-1).

AB  - Proper management of the microclimatic environment plays a main role for a more rational use of energy in greenhouses. In particular, ventilation systems in controlled environment agriculture (CEA) are essential to make the indoor environment as compatible as possible with production needs. In this study, a prototype of mechanical ventilation (SIVeMeC: Integrated System for Controlled Mechanical Ventilation) was analysed in cooling mode by simulating, through two climatic rooms, typical Summer outdoor temperature (i.e., 29 degrees C, 32 degrees C, 35 degrees C, 38 degrees C and 40 degrees C) and an indoor set-point of 24 degrees C. The main results show a very high performance of the system and reliable temperature control within the confined environment. Finally, a comparison was made with a representative commercial unit, which confirmed the suitability of SIVeMeC to efficiently manage the internal temperature.

AB  - There is no clear solution for dealing with the severe consequences of rapid urbanization. Since it cannot be reverted as a phenomenon, the scientific community has decided to look for sustainable solutions within the urban environment. An Energy-Food Nexus could optimize the way cities interact with meeting energy and food demands in intense urban environments. This work proposed a decisive solution by introducing plant factories as a support to the grid and to the local leafy greens industry. The work studied how plant factories can act as a source of load flexibility via a wind energy project. Under various scenarios analysed for a specific case in Central Greece, it was revealed that possible investors in both wind energy and plant factories, in most of the cases, they will have a full repayment period of their investment in less than 8 years, while in some cases even as low as 4 years.

AB  - Increasing the L-ascorbate (AsA) content of vegetables is very important for improving plant quality in greenhouses and plant factories because AsA is an antioxidant that is essential for the proper function of plants and the human body. End-of-production (EOP) high light irradiation is an economical preharvest practice for improving product quality. Here, we studied the dynamic responses of the AsA pool and AsA metabolism in lettuce exposed to EOP high light irradiation (300, 400, and 500 mu mol m- 2s- 1) from red and blue LEDs over a 16-h time course. Compared to the control (200 mu mol m- 2s- 1), the content of AsA and total AsA (T-AsA) in lettuce leaves significantly increased after 8 h of high light irradiation, and the contents of AsA and T-AsA increased by 42.4 % and 36.9 %, respectively, under 500 mu mol m- 2s- 1 irradiation. Transcript levels of the AsA metabolism-related genes GME, GGP, GPP, GLDH, APX, MDHAR1, MDHAR2, DHAR1, DHAR2, and GR were upregulated under higher light. Likewise, the activities of AsA-related enzymes (GLDH, APX, DHAR, and GR) increased under 500 mu mol m- 2s- 1. The expression of genes (GGP, GPP, GLDH, MDHAR1, MDHAR2, DHAR1, DHAR2, and GR) was more sensitive to high light irradiation in AsA metabolism. Both high light intensity and long irradiation time increased the soluble sugar content. Moreover, high light intensity (500 mu mol m- 2s- 1) increased the content of H2O2, O2*-, and MDA in lettuce leaves, especially at 16 h. In conclusion, EOP high light increased AsA levels by upregulating the expression of genes and the activity of enzymes in AsA metabolism. The increase in soluble sugar availability and the signaling of reactive oxygen species also contributed to AsA accumulation. We therefore recommend 8 h of high light (500 mu mol m- 2s- 1) irradiation before harvest to increase the AsA content of lettuce.

AB  - Light quality optimization is an efficient method for improving the growth and quality of lettuce in plant factories. In this study, lettuce seedlings were illuminated under different light-emitting diode (LED) lights, namely, red-blue (RB), red-blue-green (RBG), red-blue-purple (RBP), and red-blue-far-red (RBF) LED lights, to investigate the effect of light quality on growth, quality, and nitrogen metabolism. The combination of 75% red and 25% blue light was set as the basic light source, and 20% of green, purple and far-red light were added to basic light source, respectively. All the treatments were set to 200 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). Results showed that the fresh weight and dry weight of aboveground lettuce under RBG, RBP, and RBF treatments were significantly lower than those under the RB treatment because of the decrease in the effective photon flux density for chlorophyll absorption. The vitamin C content of the lettuce leaves was increased by about 23% with the addition of purple light. For nitrate reduction, the addition of green light significantly increased the nitrite content of the lettuce leaves. It also promoted the reduction from nitrite to ammonium through the activation of the nitrite reductase (NiR) expression and enzyme activity. The nitrate and ammonium content decreased with the addition of purple light because of the inhibited NR and NiR expression and enzyme activity. For nitrogen assimilation, individual (e.g., Asp, Glu, and Leu) and total amino acids were induced to increase by adding green, purple, and far-red light. The addition of light was hypothesized to have inhibited protein biosynthesis, thereby causing the accumulation of amino acids. Correlation analysis showed that the relative expression levels between HY5 and NR/NiR presented a significantly negative correlation. Transcription factor HY5 might mediate the regulation of light quality on nitrogen metabolism by inhibiting NR and NiR expressions. It might also exert a negative effect on nitrate reduction. Further studies via genome editing techniques on the identification of HY5 functions for nitrate assimilation will be valuable. Nevertheless, the results of this work enrich the understanding of the effect of light quality on nitrate metabolism at the level of gene expression and enzyme activity.

AB  - Lighting systems in controlled environment agriculture affect the economic sustainability of plant production by electricity consumption. The purpose of this experiment was to investigate the possibility of reducing the electric power consumption required for Cape periwinkle (Catharanthus roseus L. cv. Titan rose halo) and marigold (Tagetes erecta L. cv. Antigua orange) seed germination by changing the combinations of light spectra and light exposure time, and to improving energy use efficiency at seedling stage and photomorphogenesis of roots by changing spectral distribution and daily light integral (DLI). For this purpose, an experiment using various combinations of blue476nm and red625nm spectra together with broad-spectrum lamps including Fluorescent as control, high pressure sodium and white LED lights in varying light exposure times were performed. Marigold showed maximum seed germination under 2 h of red625nm light and so that Cape periwinkle under 4 h of 70 % R625nm: 30 % B476nm. The results revealed that the modification in the spectral distribution reduced the total time to achieve maximum germination, thereby diminishing the electricity consumption. Increasing DLI, irrespective of spectral distribution, resulted in a decrease in the shoot length of the marigold, but roots showed a reverse pattern. Cape periwinkle showed the same pattern except for those under 55 % R625nm: 45 % B476nm, which needed less DLI to achieve the highest root length. Combinations of blue476nm and red625nm LEDs had better energy use efficiency than control or any other broad-spectrum lamps to produce one-milligram dry matters of the shoot and root. Increasing DLI had positive effect on the number and longitudinal growth of lateral roots, and increasing blue476nm light percentage reduced their number. This study demonstrated that it was possible to increase the germination indices, control root photomorphogenesis more precisely and improve energy use efficiency by changing light combination spectra compared to broad-spectrum lamps.

AB  - The fourth industrial revolution transforms the way we approach the existing traditional systems. Agriculture is one of the crucial areas where the transformation showed its effects. With the unstoppable growth of the world population, agricultural production is under pressure to meet the increasing food demand. Today, alternative solutions such as vertical farming (VF) are sought to reach sustainable and secure food chains. VF is an indoor plant production system. The investment cost for a VF is still a challenging issue for entrepreneurs and municipalities. Therefore, having in-depth analyses is the first critical step to create sustainable food systems. This paper mainly deals with the VF technology evaluation and establishes a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) framework to assess the VF systems. A novel Pythagorean fuzzy set (PFS) with Choquet Integral model integrated is recommended for VF technology evaluation. This study aims to characterize the most feasible option from a group of VF technologies considering a group of decision makers' opinions. A real-case study for an ecological farm in Turkey is applied to test the proposed methodology's plausibility. The VF alternatives are assessed, and a suitable option is detected for the farm. A comparative assessment and a sensitivity analysis are conducted to test the suggested methodology's robustness and reliability. The outcomes and analysis are presented, and finally, conclusions and perspectives are provided.

AB  - Little is known about how exactly light plays its role in the growth of choy sum (Brassica rapa var. parachinensis), a widely cultivated vegetable in Asia. By applying a commercial soil using black peat as major constituent with 17:10:14 ratio of NPK fertilizer in this study, the growth responses of choy sum seedling to progressively increasing white LED light intensity in an indoor plant factory were investigated, where positive enhancements were observed in choy sum morphology and growth including both dry and fresh mass accumulation under higher light intensity till 400 mu mol/(m(2).s), then a reduction occurred due to light oversaturation and overheat. In indoor plant factory, the inhomogeneous distribution phenomenon of illumination level was inevitably occurred in indoor farm racks generally. For accurately evaluating the productivity of choy sum grown on such racks, a light-time-biomass response model of choy sum seedling grown at the seedling stage was thus established for the first time, which could reliably predict the production outcome of this species in indoor farming practice under various lighting condition and duration. The robustness of the model was further tested by model variation test and sufficient robustness of this model was confirmed. The new insight obtained for the light-dependence of choy sum growth and the light-time-biomass response model can be used to efficiently direct its seedling production in indoor plant factories.

AB  - The majority of the cultivated species in indoor vertical farms require many hours of light each day to reach their full potential in terms of biomass, leaf size, nutritional value, taste, and colour. At the same time, the cost of electricity can be very high due to the many hours of operation, which can be an inhibiting factor for the advancement of technology and the profitability of the farm. In this study, we tested the growth of basil plants (Ocimum basilicum) under continuous and intermittent photoperiods. The leaf physiological traits of three different photoperiod treatments were assessed and used to estimate the toleration rate of the plants under different light schedules. In the first indoor growth chamber, the plants were grown under 16 h of continuous light, in the second chamber under a normal photoperiod of 14 h with intermittent light, and in the third chamber under a load-shifting demand response with 14 h of intermittent light. The purpose was to evaluate and design flexible intermittent light exposure to reduce the electricity consumption for crops grown in indoor environments while maintaining a high growth rate and biomass production of the plants. The presented results of this experimental research show a positive correlation of the plants' responses to abiotic stress when exposed to short 10-min periods of intermittent light, without having significant effects on the physiological responses of the cultivation. The physiological, biochemical, and morphological status of the plants were assessed in terms of photosynthetic rate, chlorophyll pigments, stomatal conductance, and transpiration rate of the plants. The protocol with intermittent light exposure induced a significantly 47% increase in biomass production compared to the continuous photoperiod, resulting in a more economical, sustainable, business, and ecological impact on the energy footprint of indoor food production.

AB  - The trend to localise food production promises reduced reliance on increasingly uncertain global supply chains. Controlled-environment agriculture, in particular indoor vertical farming, is developing as part of this trend, to ensure a year-round supply of healthy food and protection from extreme weather events. However, high energy consumption is a major concern that could greatly impact the environmental sustainability of high-tech farms. Addressing the lack of comprehensive comparisons between different controlled-environment agriculture systems on a consistent basis, this work investigates the favourability of indoor vertical farms (i.e. plant factories) over modern ventilated open and closed greenhouses from an energy intensity perspective. This was based on a flexible yield-energy model incorporating detailed air conditioning system dynamics, which was developed to evaluate the influence of outside climate conditions on energy consumption and vegetable yield. The model was used to optimise the climate control strategy and to minimise hourly specific energy consumption for multiple systems, parameter settings, and locations. The hourly model performance is demonstrated for Stockholm, which indicates that advanced climate control allows for very low-energy operations in summer compared to winter. The results show a strong parametric sensitivity for the thermal transmittance of the cover, the target light intensity and the crop climate preference in all three systems, as well as the efficiency of lighting and water cooling for plant factories. Considering the yearly average for multiple locations, open greenhouses were substantially more energy-efficient than plant factories in all ten locations (from -45% in Reykjavik to -94% in Gauteng). The option to ventilate a greenhouse (open vs closed) had the greatest positive effect on specific energy consumption in less extreme climates (from -36% in Massachusetts to -83% in Gauteng) but increased water consumption considerably (from an average of similar to 2 l/kg to 26 l/kg). Although local availability of land and water plays a significant role in the choice between growing systems, the results imply that high-tech ventilated greenhouses perform significantly better than vertical farms from an energy perspective in most inhabited regions of the planet.

AB  - In indoor vertical farms, energy consumption represents a bottleneck for both a system's affordability and environmental footprint. Although switching frequency (sf) represents a crucial factor in determining the efficacy of light emitting diodes (LED) lighting systems in converting electricity into light, the impact of sf is still underexplored. The aim of this work was to investigate the effect of LEDs sf on the productive and qualitative responses of lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.), also considering the resource use efficiency. Plants were grown for 14 days under red and blue LEDs (215 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) and 16/8 h light/dark, with a red:blue ratio of 3) characterized by two different sf for the blue diode, namely high sf (850 kHz) and low sf (293 kHz). A fluorescent light (same light intensity and photoperiod) was included. LED sf did not alter plant morphological parameters, including fresh or dry biomass, leaf number, leaf area, or water use efficiency. A low sf increased the energy use efficiency (EUE) by 40% as compared to high sf. The latter enhanced the leaf antioxidant capacity, as a consequence of increased concentrations of caftaric and chicoric acids, isoquercetin, and luteolin, consistent with the upregulation of a few genes related to the biosynthetic pathway of phenolic compounds (4C3H and DFR). The study highlights that different sf may significantly affect the EUE as well as crop nutritional properties.

AB  - In a controlled environment, in an artificial light plant factory during early spring or midsummer, vegetable seedlings can be uniform, compact, and high quality. Appropriate light parameters can speed up the growth of seedlings and save on production costs. Two experiments were carried out in this study: (1) cucumber seedling growth under different daily light integrals (DLIs) (5.41-11.26 mol center dot m(-2)center dot d(-1)) and optimum DLI for seedling production were explored (experiment 1: Exp. 1); (2) under the same DLI selected by Exp. 1, the effects of different light intensities and photoperiods on cucumber seedlings were investigated (experiment 2: Exp. 2). The root biomass, root-to-shoot ratio, seedling index, and shoot dry matter rate increased as the DLI increased from 5.41 to 11.26 mol center dot m(-2)center dot d(-1), while the shoot biomass and leaf area decreased in Exp. 1. The cucumber seedlings became more compact as DLI increased, but more flowers developed after transplanting when the DLI was 6.35 mol center dot m(-2)center dot d(-1). Under the optimal DLI (6.35 mol center dot m(-2)center dot d(-1)), the optimal intensity was 110-125 mu mol center dot m(-2)center dot s(-1), and the optimal photoperiod was 14-16 h, in which plant biomass, shoot dry matter rate, seedling index, and photochemical efficiency were higher.

AB  - The global economy is now under threat due to the ongoing domestic and international lockdown for COVID-19. Many have already lost their jobs, and businesses have been unstable in the Corona era. Apart from educational institutions, banks, privately owned institutions, and agriculture, there are signs of economic recession in almost all sectors. The roles of modern technology, the Internet of things, and artificial intelligence are undeniable in helping the world achieve economic prosperity in the post-COVID-19 economic downturn. Food production must increase by 60% by 2050 to meet global food security demands in the face of uncertainty such as the COVID-19 pandemic and a growing population. Given COVID 19's intensity and isolation, improving food production and distribution systems is critical to combating hunger and addressing the double burden of malnutrition. As the world's population is growing day by day, according to an estimation world's population reaches 9.6 billion by 2050, so there is a growing need to modify the agriculture methods, technologies so that maximum crops can be attained and human effort can be reduced. The urban smart vertical farming (USVF) is a solution to secure food production, which can be introduced at any adaptive reuse, retrofit, or new buildings in vertical manners. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the concept of USVF using various techniques to enhance productivity as well as its types, topologies, technologies, control systems, social acceptance, and benefits. This review has focused on numerous issues, challenges, and recommendations in the development of the system, vertical farming management, and modern technologies approach.

AB  - Butterhead lettuce was grown hydroponically in a vertical farm under high (HLI) and low (LLI) light intensity (310, and 188 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), respectively) and compared to hydroponically grown lettuce in a greenhouse (GT) during wintertime in Athens, Greece (144 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)). The highest plant biomass was recorded in the HLI treatment, whereas LLI and GT produced similar plant biomass. However, the LLI produced vortex-like plants, which were non-marketable, while the plants in the GT were normal-shaped and saleable. Net photosynthesis was highest in the HLI and higher in the LLI than in the GT, thereby indicating that light intensity was the dominant factor affecting photosynthetic performance. Nevertheless, the unsatisfactory performance of the LLI is ascribed, not only to reduced light intensity, but also to reduced light uniformity as the LED lamps were closer to the plants than in the HLI. Furthermore, the large solar irradiance variability in the GT resulted in substantially higher adaptation to the increased light intensity compared to LLI, as indicated by chlorophyll fluorescence measurements. Light intensity and photoperiod are believed to be the primary reasons for increased nitrate content in the GT than in the vertical farming treatments.

AB  - Red and blue light are the principal wavelengths responsible for driving photosynthetic activity, yet amber light (595 nm) has the highest quantum efficiency and amber-rich high pressure sodium lamps result in superior or comparable plant performance. On this basis, we investigated how lettuce plant growth and photosynthetic activity were influenced by broad and narrow light spectra in the 590-630 nm range, by creating amber and red light-emitting diode (LED) spectra that are not commercially available. Four different light spectra were outfitted from existing LEDs using shortpass and notch filters: a double peak spectrum (595 and 655 nm; referred to as 595 + 655-nm light) that excluded 630-nm light, 595-nm, 613-nm, and 633-nm light emitting at an irradiance level of 50 W.m(-2) (243-267 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1)). Shifting LED wavelengths from 595 nm to 633 nm and from 595 nm to 613 nm resulted in a biomass yield decrease of similar to 50% and similar to 80%, respectively. When 630-nm light is blocked, lettuce displayed expanded plant structures and the absence of purple pigmentation. This report presents a new and feasible approach to plant photobiology studies, by removing certain wavelengths to assess and investigate wavelength effect on plant growth and photosynthesis. Findings indicate that amber light is superior to red light for promoting photosynthetic activity and plant productivity, and this could set precedence for future work aimed at maximizing plant productivity in controlled environment agriculture.

AB  - Nasturtium (Tropaeolum majus L.), as a medicinal plant, has a high phenolic content in its leaves and flowers. It is often used in salads as a dietary vegetable. Attracting strong demand, it could be a good candidate crop for a plant factory with artificial lighting (PFAL) that can achieve the mass production of high-quality crops with high productivity by regulating environmental conditions such as light. In this study, two experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of continuous lighting (CL) and different daily light integrals (DLIs) under CL on the growth, secondary metabolites, and light use efficiency (LUE) of nasturtium, all of which are essential in the successful cultivation in PFALs. In Experiment 1, two lighting models, the same DLI of 17.3 mol m(-2) d(-1) but different light periods (24 and 16 h) with different light intensities (200 and 300 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), respectively), were applied to nasturtium. The results showed that leaf production, secondary metabolites, and LUE were higher under the 24-h CL treatment than under the 16-h non-CL treatment. In Experiment 2, three DLI levels (17.3, 25.9, and 34.6 mol m(-2) d(-1)) under the CL condition were applied. The results showed that the growth parameters were positively correlated with the DLI levels under CL. The lowest DLI had the highest LUE. We conclude that the mass production of nasturtium under CL in PFALs is feasible, and the yield increases as DLI increases from 17.3 to 34.6 mol m(-2) d(-1) under CL without causing physiological stress on plants.

AB  - This study investigated the individual and combined effects of ultraviolet A (UV-A) and far-red (FR) light irradiation on the biomass, phytochemical accumulation, and antioxidant capacity of two lettuce cultivars in an artificial light plant factory. UV-A supplementation yielded a smaller leaf area and reduced biomass and nitrate content. In contrast, it improved the chlorophyll, soluble protein, soluble sugar, vitamin C, flavonoid, polyphenol, and anthocyanin contents and the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical-scavenging rate. FR irradiation resulted in a larger leaf area, whereas the lettuce biomass remained unchanged. Irradiation with both UV-A and FR light exhibited the most remarkable effect on leaf expansion and biomass, but reduced the phytochemical contents. A significant interaction between the cultivar and supplemented light was observed for most plant parameters.

AB  - In this paper, we study the problem of planning the growth of crops on shelves in vertical farming cabinets under controlled growth conditions. By adjusting temperature, humidity, light, and other environmental conditions in different parts of the cabinets, a planner must ensure that crop growth is able to satisfy some deterministic demand. We prove this problem to be N P-hard and propose an integer programming formulation able to capture real-life operational characteristics, including changes of growth conditions on a daily, shelf-by-shelf basis, over a planning horizon of months. We compare four objective functions from which a planner can choose, depending on the specific operations of the company. A computational study on realistic instances, which we make available as a public dataset, shows that the choice of objective function heavily influences both the difficulty of solving the model with a standard solver and the solution characteristics.

AB  - Realizing lack of information on the far-red light (FR) regulation mechanisms of glucosinolates (GSL), this study investigated the free amino acids and GSL profiles, and the expression of GSL-related genes of Chinese kale with supplementary FR (735 +/- 10 nm) at 3 W m 2 (FR-3) and 6 W m& 2 (FR-6) in the plant factory. Supplementary FR reduced the GSL accumulation without apparent dose effects. As compensate, the amounts of GSL precursor free amino acids increased. Meanwhile, 22 types of free amino acids accumulated significantly, among which 11 types showed uneven increase with FR dose, indicating that FR-3 was more efficient. Besides, key enzymes functioning upstream of desufo GSL were down-regulated by supplementary FR, which might be correlated to the down-regulation of the transcriptional activators MYB28, MYB28-like, and MYB51. Furthermore, five members of down-regulated PIFs seemed to participate in FR-regulated GSL biosynthesis. In addition, both signal and dose effects were observed in FR-regulated GSL biosynthesis.

AB  - Air temperature and light conditions are important factors not only to produce high-quality seedlings but also to promote energy efficiency in a plant factory with artificial lighting. In this study, we conducted two experiments in order to investigate the favorable conditions of air temperature, light intensity and photoperiod for the production of cucumber scions and rootstocks in a plant factory with artificial lighting. Cucumber scions and rootstocks were cultivated in two combined treatments: the combination of three different levels of difference between the day and night temperature (DIF), 25/20, 26/18 and 27/16 degrees C and five different light intensity conditions of photosynthetic photon flux, 50, 100, 150, 200 and 250 mu mol center dot m(-2)center dot s(-1) was set for the first experiment, and the combination of three different photoperiod conditions, 12, 16 and 20 h center dot d(-1) and five different light intensity conditions, 50, 100, 150, 200 and 250 mu mol center dot m(-2)center dot s(-1) was set for the second experiment. In the air temperature and light intensity treatments, the hypocotyl elongation of cucumber scions and rootstocks was affected more largely by light intensity than DIF. The highest DIF treatment (27/16 degrees C) affected negatively on the accumulation of dry mass. On the contrary, the smallest DIF treatment (25/20 degrees C) was favorable for seedling growth due to lesser stress by rapid change of air temperature between photo- and dark-period. In the photoperiod and light intensity treatments, an increased DLI (daily light integral) promoted the growth of scions and rootstocks. Under the same DLI condition, the growth of scions and rootstocks increased with increasing photoperiod and decreasing light intensity. In both of experiments, while the dry weight increased with increasing the light intensity, the light use efficiencies were reduced by increasing the light intensity. Considering the growth and quality of seedlings and energy efficiency, the optimal environment conditions were represented by 25/20 degrees C of air temperature, 150 mu mol center dot m(-2)center dot s(-1) of light intensity and 16 h center dot d(-1) of photoperiod.

AB  - Recently, the interest in the plant factory-based crop production technologies is rising following the application of the smart farm technology to the agricultural arena. A lettuce production system platform is proposed in this study considering the effects of indoor environmental conditions and artificial light sources. The spectral characteristics of a visible ray according to growth performances were analyzed first to develop a control algorithm that can stimulate the plant's growth for the proposal. Secondly, an imaging system was designed to analyze the plant's growth characteristics based on the images and set up the system configuration. Lastly, a crop production system was proposed by using an experimental crop production group for environmental control and monitoring.

AB  - We evaluated the effect of a newly-developed nutrient solution of red perilla (NSP) with various electrical conductivity (EC) levels on plant growth, mineral content, and bioactive compounds. Four-week-old seedlings were grown in greenhouse nutrient solution as control (CT) (EC 1-3 dS m(-1)) or NSP (EC 1-6 dS m(-1)). NSP 1 dS m(-1) induced better growth characteristics, whereas higher EC levels inhibited plant growth. Most of the macro-elements contents significantly decreased under NSP 6 dS m(-1), whereas the micro-elements contents fluctuated according to EC levels. Total phenolic concentration in NSP was lower than that in CT, and total phenolic content was highest under NSP 1 dS m(-1). Total anthocyanin and antioxidant concentrations and contents increased at lower EC levels. Rosmarinic and caffeic acids concentrations increased at higher EC levels, whereas there were no significant differences in these compound contents among the EC levels. No difference in perillaldehyde concentration was observed, whereas the content was higher at lower EC levels. Overall, these results suggest that NSP 1 dS m(-1) is suitable for cultivating red perilla in plant factories.

AB  - Threats from climate change, environmental degradation, and exhausted Green Revolution technologies have caused widespread concern for the future of global crop production and food security. Today, the agri-sector is transitioning on a global scale, away from traditional farming practices and towards adopting the novel technologies needed to sustainably intensify food production. With the global population projected to reach nine billion by 2050, with 68% of us living in urban environments, it is essential to find ways of producing food crops sustainably both in cities as well as out in the field. Modern innovation presents an opportunity to remedy these issues through the implementation of novel technologies and practices, including vertical farming, light supplementation via light-emitting diodes (LEDs), artificial intelligence (AI), advances within plant breeding genetics, and the application of biostimulants made from organic extracts. Throughout this review, we will provide insights into the future of farming by discussing a range of contemporary agricultural techniques and technologies, alongside the cultural, economic, and environmental contexts that necessitate their increased application.

AB  - Light emitting diodes (LEDs) have recently been considered an efficient artificial light source in plant factories for enhancing plant growth and nutritional quality. Accordingly, this study aimed to review blue, red, and white LED light sources for efficiency and length of the growing period to produce seedlings of Scutellaria baicalensis with high nutritional value. The roots, stems, and leaves of S. baicalensis seedlings were grown under different LED lights and harvested after two and four weeks, and analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry to identify and quantify primary and secondary metabolites. Roots, particularly in the seedlings treated with white LEDs were determined to contain the greatest concentrations of the representative compounds present in S. baicalensis: baicalin, baicalein, and wogonin, which show highly strong biological properties compared to the other plant organs. A total of 50 metabolites (amino acids, sugars, sugar alcohols, organic acids, phenolic acids, and amines) were detected in the roots, stems, and leaves of S. baicalensis seedlings, and the concentrations of primary and secondary metabolites were generally decreased with the increasing duration of LED illumination. Therefore, this study suggests that white LED light and a 2-week growing period are the most efficient conditions for the production of baicalin, baicalein, and wogonin.

AB  - Closed production systems, such as plant factories and vertical farms, have emerged to ensure a sustainable supply of fresh food, to cope with the increasing consumption of natural resource for the growing population. In a plant factory, a microclimate model is one of the direct control components of a whole system. In order to better realize the dynamic regulation for the microclimate model, energy-saving and consumption reduction, it is necessary to optimize the environmental parameters in the plant factory, and thereby to determine the influencing factors of atmosphere control systems. Therefore, this study aims to identify accurate microclimate models, and further to predict temperature change based on the experimental data, using the classification and regression trees (CART) algorithm. A random forest theory was used to represent the temperature control system. A mechanism model of the temperature control system was proposed to improve the performance of the plant factories. In terms of energy efficiency, the main influencing factors on temperature change in the plant factories were obtained, including the temperature and air volume flow of the temperature control device, as well as the internal relative humidity. The generalization error of the prediction model can reach 0.0907. The results demonstrated that the proposed model can present the quantitative relationship and prediction function. This study can provide a reference for the design of high-precision environmental control systems in plant factories.

AB  - Since red (R) and blue (B) LED light has different quantum efficiency and photoelectric conversion efficiency, mixed RB with different proportions of R and B results in varied energy consumption. In order to improve the energy use efficiency of the closed-type plant production systems, the effects of R and B proportions on the electric use efficiency (EUE), light use efficiency (LUE) as well as the quality of butter leaf lettuce were evaluated in this study. Lettuce seedlings were cultivated in a plant factory with artificial lighting (PFAL) and subjected to eleven combinations of R and B (100%R, 90%R, 80%R, 70%R, 60%R, 50%R, 40%R, 30%R, 20%R, 10%R, 0%R; the rest of the photons in each treatment were B) with the same total photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) and photoperiod (200 +/- 3 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1), 16 h) for 35 days. The results showed that palpable petiole distortion appeared when R proportion was more than 70% and the distortion was aggravated with the increase of R proportion. The highest EUE and LUE were both detected in lettuce under 90%R treatment, which were respectively 3.64% and 1.20%. The least number of photons and the least electricity amount required to produce 1 g dry weight of lettuce was respectively 2.92 mol and 1.67 MJ, which were both detected in lettuce treated with 90%R. The sucrose content in lettuce treated with more than 50%R was significantly higher than those treated with less than 50%R (50%R included). Lettuce treated with 80%R possessed the highest soluble sugar content as well as the lowest crude fiber and nitrate content (not significantly different with the minimum values). R proportion exceeding 50% in mixed RB light was beneficial to the accumulation of hexose and sucrose, as well as the decomposition of nitrate in lettuce. The vitamin C content in lettuce treated with 100%R was significantly higher than that in lettuce under other treatments in the study. On the whole, the study indicated that the proportions of R and B affected the energy use efficiency and quality of lettuce in closed plant factory, however the responses of plants to the proportions of R and B varied according to different indexes. Thus, some indexes of top priority should be determined before choosing the optimal proportions of R and B.

AB  - The development of green spaces in urban areas is rapidly on the rise as more people are keen to maintain a clean and green atmosphere around where they live and work. Also, the link between the physical world and the internet has been a driving force in enhancing people?s quality of life which has resulted in the most recent and rising technologies, collectively referred to as the Internet of Things (IoT). The adoption of vertical gardens (VG) and/or vertical farms (VF) can be beneficial for maintaining a sustainable environment, as well as for expanding food security in an urban context around the world with limited land space. IoT technologies have the potential to be key enablers in the accelerated adoption of VG. In this study, we investigate the critical parameters for automating sustainable vertical gardening systems by using the IoT concept in smart cities towards smart living. This involves collection and review of data from 30 peer-reviewed publications published between 2004 and 2018, including real-world VG implementations. The key criteria considered include: (i) crop/plant type, (ii) VG topology (size), (iii) sensing data, (iv) used hardware (sensors, actuators, etc.), (v) power supplies, (vi) velocity or frequency of data collection, (vii) data storage method, (viii) communication technologies, (ix) data analysis methods/algorithm, (x) other used strategies, and (xi) countries that implemented VGs. The data were subsequently analyzed to obtain a detailed understanding of using IoT in VGs. The results of the analysis revealed that most of the studies used 6-20 tiers (40%) when implementing VGs, and the most popular crop was lettuce (28.6%). The sensors used were commonly connected to AC power and battery (each 44.4%), while only a small proportion of VGs used solar power (11.1%). The majority of IoT sensors used were to measure room temperature (22.5%), light intensity (21.1%), humidity level (14%) and soil nutrition (7%). The frequency of data collection by these sensors was between 1 and 3 minutes (42.8%). The frequently used data transmission technology was Zigbee and Wi-Fi (42.8%) for collecting sensor data from VGs. We also found that, using the server database, remote data management platform and cloud were the most popular data storage methods (each 25%). After data collection, many studies used threshold-based algorithms (50%) for the decision making, and the soil-based (42%) and hydroponic (38%) were the most popular plant cultivation technologies. The use of recycled and reused water (30%), solar power (20%) and controlled indoor environment, without sun or soil (20%) are some of the other essential considerations in VGs. Furthermore, it was found that the most significant focus on automation of VGs incorporating IoT were in USA (41.2%) and China (23.5%). The impact of vertical cultivation walls on human well-being was discussed. In addition to this, eight international patents on VGs have been analyzed to acquire an implementation understanding of autonomous control or using IoT in vertical gardens.

AB  - Vapor pressure deficit (VPD) is considered to be one of the major environmental factors influencing stomatal functions and photosynthesis, as well as plant growth in crop and horticultural plants. In the greenhouse cultivation, air temperature and relative air humidity are regulated by switching on/off the evaporative systems and opening/closing the roof windows, which causes VPD fluctuation. However, it remains unclear how VPD fluctuation affects photosynthetic and growth performance in plants. Here, we examined the effects of the VPD fluctuation on the photosynthetic and growth characteristics in lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.). The parameters for gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence and biomass production were evaluated under the conditions of drastic (1.63 kPa for 6 min and 0.63 for 3 min) or moderate (1.32 kPa for 7 min and 0.86 kPa for 3 min) VPD fluctuation. The drastic VPD fluctuation induced gradual decrease in stomatal conductance and thus CO2 assimilation rate during the measurements, while moderate VPD fluctuation caused no reduction of these parameters. Furthermore, data showed moderate VPD fluctuation maintained leaf expansion and the efficiency of CO2 diffusion across leaf surface, resulting in enhanced plant growth compared with drastic VPD fluctuation. Taken together, fine regulation of VPD can be crucial for better plant growth by maintaining the photosynthetic performance in lettuce. The present work demonstrates the importance of VPD control during plant cultivation in plant factories and greenhouses.

AB  - Vertical farming is increasingly popular due to high yields obtained from a small land area. However, the energy cost associated with lighting of vertical farms is high. To reduce this cost, more energy efficient (biomass/energy use) crops are required. To understand how efficiently crops use light energy to produce biomass, we determined the morphological and physiological differences between mizuna (Brassica rapa var. japonica) and lettuce (Lactuca sativa 'Green Salad Bowl'). To do so, we measured the projected canopy size (PCS, a morphological measure) of the plants throughout the growing cycle to determine the total amount of incident light the plants received. Total incident light was used together with the final dry weight to calculate the light use efficiency (LUE, g of dry weight/mol of incident light), a physiological measure. Plants were grown under six photosynthetic photon flux densities (PPFD), from 50 to 425 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), for 16 h d(-1). Mizuna and lettuce were harvested 27 and 28 days after seeding, respectively. Mizuna had greater dry weight than lettuce (p < 0.0001), especially at higher PPFDs (PPFD >= 125 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)), partly because of differences in the projected canopy size (PCS). Mizuna had greater PCS than lettuce at PPFDs >= 125 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) and therefore, the total incident light over the growing period was also greater. Mizuna also had a higher LUE than lettuce at all six PPFDs. This difference in LUE was associated with higher chlorophyll content index and higher quantum yield of photosystem II in mizuna. The combined effects of these two factors resulted in higher photosynthetic rates in mizuna than in lettuce (p = 0.01). In conclusion, the faster growth of mizuna is the result of both a larger PCS and higher LUE compared to lettuce. Understanding the basic determinants of crop growth is important when screening for rapidly growing crops and increasing the efficiency of vertical farms.

AB  - The effect of multicolor pulsed light-emitting diode (LED) irradiation on lettuce "Defender" growth, photosynthetic performance and antioxidant properties was studied. The experiments were designed to compare the continuous and pulsed lighting (0.5, 1 kHz; 50% duty ratio) effects of B450, G520, R660 and FR735 lighting components, maintaining total diurnal integral light quantity (DLI 14.4 mol m(-2) day(-1)) constant during the 16-h photoperiod. The results showed that lettuce grown under pulsed irradiation displayed superior growth performance, including a significant enhancement of fresh (similar to 32%) and dry biomass (similar to 36%) and leaf area (similar to 48%). Lettuce cultivated in both pulsed light treatments was characterized by the higher photosynthetic rate, chlorophyll (a,b) and carotenoid concentration. However, the total phenol and antioxidant properties in lettuce were more dependent on the specific pulsed light frequency. Only treatment with 1 kHz frequency was effective for higher phenol content, 2,20-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) free radical scavenging activity and Fe2+ reducing antioxidant power (FRAP). Thus, our results propose the role of pulsed LED light in improving the photosynthetic efficiency and antioxidative properties of lettuce plants cultivated indoors. In the future, pulsed lighting techniques should be included in the development of artificial lighting systems in controlled environment agriculture (CEA) to produce high-quality crops with the possibility to save electricity.

AB  - Human population is projected to reach 9.7 billion in 2050 and strike 11.2 billion by 2100. Residence shift from countryside to cities will occur and the human population resides in the cities is envisaged to rise from 55% to 68%. Vertical farming was proposed to address food insecurity caused by overcrowded population and farmland shortages. The compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of vertical farming in the Asia Pacific is forecasted to grow at 22.1% with a market size reaching USD 2,101.0 million by 2024. Malaysian government encourages the implementation of vertical farming as the production of major agricultural commodities has contracted by 3.4% from 2015 to 2017. However, high energy consumption is one of the shortcomings of a vertical farm as the estimated annual energy consumption for each square meter of growing area is 3500 kW h. Thus, this paper proposes an optimized building geometry modeling integrated with energy yield estimation tool to evaluate the potential of integrating green energy into urban agriculture. This research examines the load demand in the vertical farming systems and develops solar/hybrid/storage for vertical farming system with energy yield, performance ratio, economics and environmental assessments. Preliminary resources assessment by analyzing the solar radiation of the sites was carried out at stage 1. At stage 2, load consumption was calculated, and specifications of the system were justified. Stage 3 included the development of solar PV system for the vertical farms, the economic evaluation in the context of net present cost (NPC), levelized cost of energy (LCOE) and investigation of the environmental impact. Grid-connected and standalone solar PV systems were developed for comparative studies. The estimated daily energy consumption for vertical farms in Selangor and Kuching was 430.116 kW h and 1002.024 kW h. Energy generated by grid-connected solar PV systems supported 11.6% and 8.35% of the load consumption in Selangor and Sarawak. The performance ratios of grid-connected solar PV systems in both selected sites were 82.22% and 82.56%. The finding proved that proposed work has significantly reduced the dependency of the utility grid. Additionally, the LCOE with solar PV integration vertical farming system appeared to be lower than the LCOE of the grid and lower CO2 emission. This paper serves as a reference guide to the vertical farming stakeholders, national policy-decision makers and non-profit organizations who planned for similar initiatives especially those within the tropical climate regions.

AB  - To determine the optimal light intensity and enable plants to cope with various environmental stresses in plant factories, the morphological and photosynthetic characteristics of ginseng seedlings, including the secondary metabolites, were investigated under six light intensities: 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, and 150 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). The shoot length increased with lower light intensity up to 75 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), and the leaf area and specific leaf weight were greatest at 100 and 75 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), respectively. Stomata frequency was higher from 100 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) with higher light intensity, and single stomatal pore length also increased at 150 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). Net photosynthetic rate at light saturation and net photosynthetic rate in growth condition increased sequentially up to 100 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) before rapidly decreasing at 150 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). The dark respiration rate and light compensation point were significantly high at 150 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) only. Fv/Fm and chlorophyll content statistically differed from 63 and 84 days after seedling stand, respectively. Thus, the leaves withered to death with higher light intensity. The ginsenoside content in the roots significantly increased according to the light intensity, and the panaxadiol/panaxatriol (PT) ratio tended to decrease as the PT-type ginsenosides increased further. Taken together, the range of 75-100 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) was found to be beneficial for growth, photosynthetic acclimation response, and total accumulated ginsenosides of ginseng seedlings.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the effects of UV-A light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and lamps on the growth and bioactive compounds of ice plant (Mesembryanthemum crystallinum). Three-week-old seedlings were germinated and grown at 23 degrees C air temperature, 60% relative humidity, 1000 mu mol mol(-1) CO2, 200 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) (white LEDs), and a photo-period of 12 h for 3 weeks in a plant factory with artificial lighting. Plants were supplementally irradiated with different peak wavelengths of UV-A LEDs (395, 385, 375, and 365 nm) of 30 W m(-2) and UV-A lamps of 15.5 W m(-2) continuously for 7 days. Treatment with 395, 385, and 375 nm increased shoot fresh and dry weights than the control at 5 and 7 days of treatment. F-v/F-m value was significantly decreased at 12 h of all UV-A treatments and consistently showed lower levels compared to the control during the entire period. The photosynthetic rates of the 395 and 385 nm treatments were significantly higher than those of the other treatments. UV-A treatment enhanced total phenolic content and antioxidant capacity compared to those of the control after 3 days of treatment. Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase activity was also increased by UV-A light exposure. The content of pinitol, myo-inositol, and sucrose was increased by UV-A radiation, and the highest values were observed in the 395 nm treatment at 5 and 7 days of treatment. Our findings suggest that supplemental radiation of UV-A with a peak wavelength near 400 nm could increase the shoot biomass and antioxidant phenolics and sugar alcohols in ice plants.

AB  - Glucosinolates (GLs), found in Brassicaceae family, are precursor metabolites with anti-cancer properties. Increased GLs have been studied under various environmental growth conditions. Pak choi (Brassica rapa subsp. chinensis) is a GL-rich vegetable. We hypothesize that long exposure to light and drought will increase the biomass of, and GL production in, pak choi. The experiment was conducted for 6 weeks. Long light exposure (20 h/day) increased, whilst drought exposure (12 h/week) decreased the plant growth. The plants exposed to a combination of drought and long light conditions showed similar growth pattern as control plants. GL production increased at week 6 in plants exposed to long light, while drought exposure had no impact on GL production, with the exception of glucoraphanin. Significant positive correlations were observed between plant growth and GL yield with accumulated light exposure time. Our findings suggest that long exposure to light can be used to increase both the biomass and GL production in pak choi.

AB  - Food production and consumption related environmental challenges have come to the forefront of policy discourse in the past decade. This links primarily to concerns in terms of agriculture fueling climate change, but also in terms of long-term food security and availability for growing populations. A proposed solution to these pressures at the urban scale is Vertical Farming (VF), in the understanding of this article, a high-yield form of controlled environment agriculture, staked on multiple layers, which promises to produce leafy greens and vegetables within cities, with potential to reduce the resource intensity of urban food production and consumption. The particular contextual conditions required for VF to be sustainable have not as of yet been holistically assessed. Accordingly, by analyzing these contextual conditions in the Global North, this research assesses how VF can be up-scaled for the sake of sustainability - particularly climate mitigation - by viewing urban food systems through the Multi-Level Perspective. The article presents three findings in relation to the up-scaling potential of VF. Firstly, singular VF interventions in cities should have further functions integrated at the scale of the farm for the sake of viability. Secondly, VF interventions carry the most potential for climate mitigation if they are viewed through urban-level systemic food planning, which sheds light on the contextual conditions needed for VF to contribute to sustainability. Finally, the globalized dynamics of the neoliberal political economy, and in turn the localized effects for food systems, have implications for VF that need to be taken into consideration in framing up-scaling policy.

AB  - Common pollutants in indoor air include carbon dioxide (CO2), particulate matter (PM) and volatile organic compounds (VOC). Apart from ventilation and dilution method, there are currently many practical filtration and absorption methods for PM and VOC pollutants. However, most of these approaches are not applicable for reducing indoor CO2 concentration. The introduction of vertical farming (VF) into buildings is one of the latest directions in ecological design, which can absorb CO2 and release oxygen based on the plant photosynthesis. Office buildings are particularly suitable for integrated VF due to their spatial form, working hours and other characteristics. In this study, the effect of VF on indoor CO2 concentration was investigated in an enclosed office. Additionally, the reduction in building ventilating energy consumption by using the VF was assessed. Results concluded that the CO2 absorption rate of the VF vegetables can be up to 9.2 times higher than that of shadeloving landscape plants owing to higher net photosynthetic rate (NPR). And also, for a normal 30 m2 office with 1?3 occupants, the indoor CO2 concentration of a 100-plant-scale VF could be reduced by 25.7%?34.3% resulting in a reduction in building ventilating energy consumption by 12.7%?58.4% on the basis of the number of occupants and growth status of VF.

AB  - Indoor growing systems with light-emitting diodes offer advantages for the growth of tomato seedlings through uniform and optimized environmental conditions which increase consistency between plants and growing cycles. CO2 enrichment has been shown to improve the yield of crops. Thus, this research aimed to characterize the effects of varied light intensities and CO2 enrichment on the growth, morphology, and production efficiency of tomato seedlings in indoor growing systems. Four tomato cultivars, "Florida-47 R," "Rebelski," "Maxifort," and "Shin Cheong Gang," were subjected to three different daily light integrals (DLIs) of 6.5, 9.7, and 13 mol m(-2) d(-1) with a percent photon flux ratio of 40 blue:60 red and an end-of-day far-red treatment of 5 mmol m(-2) d(-1). The plants were also subjected to three different CO2 concentrations: 448 +/- 32 (400-ambient), 1010 +/- 45 (1000), and 1568 +/- 129 (1600) mu mol mol(-1). Temperature was maintained at 24.3 degrees C +/- 0.48/16.8 degrees C +/- 1.1 (day/dark; 22.4 degrees C average) and relative humidity at 52.56 +/- 8.2%. Plant density was 1000 plants m(-2) until canopy closure. Morphological measurements were conducted daily to observe the growth response over time. In addition, data was collected to quantify the effects of each treatment. The results showed increases in growth rate with increases in the DLI and CO2 concentration. In addition, CO2 enrichment to 1000-1600 mu mol mol(-1) increased the light use efficiency (g(DM) mol(-1) (applied)) by 38-44%, and CO2 enrichment to 1600 mu mol mol(-1) did not result in any additional increase on shoot fresh mass, shoot dry mass, and stem extension. However, the net photosynthetic rate obtained with 1600 mu mol mol(-1) was 31 and 68% higher than those obtained with 1000 and 400 mu mol mol(-1), respectively. Furthermore, the comparison of the light and CO2 treatment combinations with the control (13 mol m(-2) d(-1)-400CO(2)) revealed that the plants subjected to 6.5DLI-1600CO(2), 9.7DLI-1000CO(2), and 9.7DLI-1600CO(2) treatment combinations exhibited the same growth rate as the control plants but with 25-50% less DLI. Furthermore, two treatment combinations (13.0DLI-1000CO(2) and 13.0DLI-1600CO(2)) were associated with the consumption of comparable amount of energy but increased plant growth by 24-33%.

AB  - The spectral reflectance technique for the quantification of the functional components was applied in different studies for different crops, but related research on kale leaves is limited. This study was conducted to estimate the glucosinolate and anthocyanin components of kale leaves cultivated in a plant factory based on diffuse reflectance spectroscopy through regression methods. Kale was grown in a plant factory under different treatments. After specific periods of transplantation, leaf samples were collected, and reflectance spectra were measured immediately from nine different points on each leaf. The same leaf samples were freeze-dried and stored for analysis of the functional components. Regression procedures, such as principal component regression (PCR), partial least squares regression (PLSR), and stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR), were applied to relate the functional components with the spectral data. In the laboratory analysis, progoitrin and glucobrassicin, as well as cyanidin and malvidin, were found to be dominating components in glucosinolates and anthocyanins, respectively. From the overall analysis, the SMLR model showed better performance, and the identified wavelengths for estimating the glucosinolates and anthocyanins were in the early near-infrared (NIR) region. Specifically, reflectance at 742, 761, 787, 796, 805, 833, 855, 932, 947, and 1000 nm showed a strong correlation.

AB  - Controlled environment agriculture (CEA), specifically advanced greenhouses, plant factories, and vertical farms, has a significant role to play in the urban agri-food landscape through provision of fresh and nutritious food for urban populations. With the push towards improving sustainability of these systems, a circular or closed-loop approach for managing resources is desirable. These crop production systems generate biowaste in the form of crop and growing substrate residues, the disposal of which not only impacts the immediate environment, but also represents a loss of valuable resources. Closing the resource loop through composting of crop residues and urban biowaste is presented. Composting allows for the recovery of carbon dioxide and plant nutrients that can be reused as inputs for crop production, while also providing a mechanism for managing and valorizing biowastes. A conceptual framework for integrating carbon dioxide and nutrient recovery through composting in a CEA system is described along with potential environmental benefits over conventional inputs. Challenges involved in the recovery and reuse of each component, as well as possible solutions, are discussed. Supplementary technologies such as biofiltration, bioponics, ozonation, and electrochemical oxidation are presented as means to overcome some operational challenges. Gaps in research are identified and future research directions are proposed.

AB  - To produce high-quality broccoli microgreens, suitable light intensity for growth and phytochemical contents of broccoli microgreens in an artificial light plant factory were studied. Broccoli microgreens were irradiated under different photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD): 30, 50, 70 and 90 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1) with red: green: blue = 1:1:1 light-emitting diodes (LEDs). The broccoli microgreens grown under 50 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1) had the highest fresh weight, dry weight, and moisture content, while the phytochemical contents were the lowest. With increasing light intensity, the chlorophyll content increased, whereas the carotenoid content decreased. The contents of soluble protein, soluble sugar, free amino acid, flavonoid, vitamin C, and glucosinolates except for progoitrin in broccoli microgreens were higher under 70 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1). Overall, 50 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1) was the optimal light intensity for enhancement of growth of broccoli microgreens, while 70 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1) was more feasible for improving the phytochemicals of broccoli microgreens in an artificial light plant factory.

AB  - Different strategies are reported in the literature for energy saving in Closed Plant Production Systems (CPPS). However, not reliable evidences about energy consumption with the use of pulsed LED light technique in lighting system available in Plant Factory and Vertical Farm. In this work, three key points to determine the effects of pulsed LED light versus continuous LED light are presented: (1) A mathematical model and its practical application for stabilizing the energy equivalence using LED light in continuous and pulsed mode in different light treatments. (2) The quantum efficiency of the photosystem II was used to determine positive and/or negative effects of the light operating mode (continuous or pulsed) on chili pepper plants (Capsicum annuum var. Serrano). (3) Evaluation of energy consumption with both operation modes using ten recipes from the literature to grow plants applied in Closed Plant Production Systems, different Photosynthetic Photon Flux Density at 50, 110, and 180 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), Frequencies at 100, 500, and 1000 Hz, and Duty Cycles of 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, and 90%. The results show no significant statistical differences between the operation modes (continuous and pulsed LED light). For each light recipe analyzed, a pulsed frequency and a duty cycle were obtained, achieving significant energy savings in every light intensity. The results can be useful guide for real-life applications in CPPS.

AB  - Agrivoltaics (AV) is an innovative approach in which solar photovoltaic (PV) energy generation is collocated with agricultural production to enable food-energy-water synergies and landscape ecological conservation. This dual-use requirement leads to unique cooptimization challenges (e.g., shading, soiling, and spacing) that make module technology and farm topology choices distinctly different from the traditional solar farms. Here, we compare the performance of the traditional optimally titled North/South (N/S)-faced monofacial farms with a potential alternative based on vertical East/West (E/W)-faced bifacial farms. Remarkably, the vertical farm produces essentially the same energy output and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) compared with the traditional farms as long as the PV array density is reduced to half or lower relative to that for the standard ground-mounted PV farms. Our results explain the relative merits of the traditional monofacial versus vertical bifacial farms as a function of array density, acceptable PAR deficit, and energy production. The combined PAR/Energy yields for the vertical bifacial farm may not always be superior, it could still be an attractive choice for AV due to its distinct advantages such as minimum land coverage, least hindrance to the farm machinery and rainfall, inherent resilience to PV soiling, easier cleaning, and cost advantages due to the potentially reduced elevation.

AB  - The production of low potassium vegetables arose out of the dietary needs of patients with renal dysfunction. Attempts have been made to reduce potassium content in vegetables and fruits; however, induced potassium deficiency has often resulted in decreased yields. Here, we investigated a new method of producing low potassium kale and present the characteristics of the resulting produce. By substituting potassium nitrate with calcium nitrate in the nutrient solution 2 weeks before harvesting, the potassium content of kale was reduced by 70% without a deterioration in yield and semblance qualities. Despite no relationships being detected between potassium deficiency and anti-oxidative properties, the total glucosinolate content, an indicator of the anti-cancer effect of cruciferous vegetables, was significantly increased by potassium deficiency in kale. This study demonstrates a novel method of producing low potassium kale for patients with renal failure, without a reduction in yield but with beneficial increase in glucosinolates.

AB  - Vertical indoor farming under artificial lighting has gained attention as a novel means of food production. However, consumer acceptance of vegetable crops grown under artificial conditions is not well understood. Our nationwide online survey of 289 Russians gathered attitudes and opinions toward vertically farmed vegetables. Employing an ordered logit model and a two-mode co-occurrence network analysis, we show how respondents' attitudes relate to their key demographic characteristics and opinions about the vegetables. Results indicate that respondents' attitudes are heterogeneous and related to their region of residence, income level, and opinions regarding nutrients, safety, and taste. Respondents in the Central and Volga districts exhibited less favorable attitudes. Less favorably inclined respondents viewed the produce as unnatural, less nutritious, bad-tasting, and even dangerous, presumably because of misconceptions or lack of knowledge. On the other hand, respondents with monthly income above RUB 60,001 (1018 USD, 867 EURO) had relatively positive attitudes toward such vegetables. Respondents having positive attitudes saw the vegetables as safe, tasty, and of good quality. We discuss the political and commercial implications of these findings.

AB  - A dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) is one of the emerging photovoltaic technologies that shows promising prospects in the commercial applications because of its semitransparency, low manufacturing cost, facile fabrication procedures, and good performance under low-light conditions. Despite the aforementioned advantages of DSSC technology, the transition from laboratory to industrial applications is hindered by several major obstacles. This article aims to explore the potential of DSSC technology in real-life applications, namely, building-integrated photovoltaic, indoor energy harvesting, and smart farming, and the research challenges that must be overcome to pave the way for DSSC commercialization. The challenges can be categorized into the long-term stability issue and difficulty related to the scale-up processes. This article also presents insights into the potentials of DSSCs in smart farming and controlled-environment agriculture, which were never been reported before.

The experiment developed within an issue mapping project, analysing debates about vertical farming on the digital platforms, Twitter and Instagram. The article presents a software tool designed to engage 'offline' publics in the issue mapping process, using images collected from Instagram. We describe testing this software tool with visitors to exhibitions of vertical farming in two science and technology museums. Our findings highlight the predominance of commercial publicity about vertical farming on Twitter and Instagram and the organisation of public attention around technological novelty. The article discusses the challenges such publicity dynamics pose to mapping issues on platforms. We suggest some ways digital methods might contribute to public engagement with technologies, like vertical farming, that are a focus of organised commercialised innovation.

AB  - Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA) applications, such as vertical farms and plant factories, have the potential to shift food production to be close to urban centers helping meet demands of large populations as well as achieving global climate goals. Growing crops in controlled environments has proven to be feasible for several applications, however, most involve energy intensive processes. The review analysis presented in this paper seeks to overview current CEA practices as well as potential energy efficiency technologies that can enhance the sustainability and the profitability of the indoor farming industry. Specifically, the paper reviews various CEA techniques, optimal indoor growing environments, successful case studies, and recommended energy systems research. The review analysis indicates that changes to a facility?s envelope, HVAC, lighting, and incorporation of distributed generation technology can reduce consumption of electricity up to 75% in several CEA case studies. Future research into controls, dehumidification, lighting, and crop variety are vital for a wider adoption of CEA applications.

AB  - Growing demand for horticultural products of accentuated sensory, nutritional, and functional quality traits has been driven by the turn observed in affluent societies toward a healthy and sustainable lifestyle relying principally on plant-based food. Growing plants under protected cultivation facilitates more precise and efficient modulation of the plant microenvironment, which is essential for improving vegetable quality. Among the environmental parameters that have been researched for optimization over the past, air relative humidity has always been in the background and it is still unclear if and how it can be modulated to improve plants' quality. In this respect, two differentially pigmented (green and red) Salanova(R) cultivars (Lactuca sativa L. var. capitata) were grown under two different Vapor Pressure Deficits (VPDs; 0.69 and 1.76 kPa) in a controlled environment chamber in order to appraise possible changes in mineral and phytochemical composition and in antioxidant capacity. Growth and morpho-physiological parameters were also analyzed to better understand lettuce development and acclimation mechanisms under these two VPD regimes. Results showed that even though Salanova plants grown at low VPD (0.69 kPa) increased their biomass, area, number of leaves and enhanced Fv/Fm ratio, plants at high VPD increased the levels of phytochemicals, especially in the red cultivar. Based on these results, we have discussed the role of high VPD facilitated by controlled environment agriculture as a mild stress aimed to enhance the quality of leafy greens.

AB  - Plant production in a plant factory is an innovative and smart idea to grow food anytime, anywhere, regardless of the outer environment. However, potato pre-basic seed tuber (PBST) production in a plant factory is a comparatively new initiative. Therefore, the aim of this study was to optimize the artificial LED light spectrum to produce PBST in a plant factory. Two potato varieties such as Golden king (V48) and Chungang (V41) were grown in soil substrate under different combination of artificial LED light combinations (such as red+blue+far-red, red+blue+white, blue+far-red, blue+white, red+far-red, and red+white) maintaining photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) of 100 mol m(-2)s(-1), temperature 23/15 degrees C (day/night), and relative humidity 70%. The study revealed that, overall, potato plant growth (viz.; plant height, node number, leaf number, leaf length and width, fresh and dry weight) was enhanced by the red+far red light for both potato varieties. The total seed tuber number per plant was higher in red+blue+white light for V48, and red+far-red for V41. The fresh tuber weight was the highest in the red+blue+far-red light for V48 and red+blue+white for V41. The highest accumulated photosynthetic pigment (total Chlorophyll, Chlorophyll a, b and Carotenoid) was observed in red+blue+white light for both varieties. The total carbohydrate content and total sucrose content were higher in red+blue+far red and red+far red light treatment for V48 and V41, respectively. Finally, considering all factors, it is concluded that the red+blue+white light combination is deemed to be appropriate for the potato PBST production in plant factory conditions.

AB  - Nasturtium is a popular herbal plant, widely cultivated as culinary and medicinal plants all over the world. However, the seed propagation of nasturtium is inefficient, and in-vitro propagation is sophisticated and high-cost. In this study, the cutting propagation method was employed to produce nasturtium seedlings. We aimed to determine the optimal conditions for cutting propagation of nasturtium seedlings by investigating the effects of node position and electric conductivity (EC) of nutrient solution on the root formation of the cuttings. Cuttings from five node positions (apical bud, 2nd node, 3rd node, 4th node, and 5th node) were subjected to water and five EC (1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0 dS m(-1)) treatments with a hydroponic cultivation system in a plant factory. Results showed that all cuttings rooted successfully within two weeks. The cuttings from the apical bud position rooted earliest and produced the most roots regardless of EC level. Cuttings from other node positions produced longer roots and heavier root fresh and dry weights than those from the apical bud position. The cuttings under EC of 1.0 dS m(-1) had the greatest root number, the longest root length, and the heaviest root fresh and dry weights regardless of node positions. The EC of 1.0 dS m(-1) is considered the best condition for nasturtium cuttings for the range of EC tested in this study, and the cuttings from all the five node positions can be used as seedling materials.

AB  - The cost of providing lighting in greenhouses and plant factories can be high. In the case of variable electricity prices, providing most of the light when electricity prices are low can reduce costs. However, it is not clear how plants respond to the resulting fluctuating light levels. We hypothesized that plants that receive a constant photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) will produce more biomass than those grown under fluctuating light levels. To understand potential growth reductions caused by fluctuating light levels, we quantified the effects of fluctuating PPFD on the photosynthetic physiology, morphology, and growth of 'Little Gem' and 'Green Salad Bowl' lettuce. Plants were grown in a growth chamber with dimmable white LED bars, alternating between high and low PPFDs every 15 min. The PPFDs were similar to 400/0, 360/40, 320/80, 280/120, 240/160, and 200/200 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1), with a photoperiod of 16 h and a DLI of similar to 11.5 mol.m(-2).day(-1) in all treatments. CO2 was similar to 800 mu mol.mol(-1). Plants in the 400/0 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1) treatment had similar to 69% lower A(n),(30) (net assimilation averaged over 15 min at high and 15 min at low PPFD) than plants grown at a PPFD of 320/80 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1) (or treatments with smaller PPFD fluctuations). The low A(n),(30) in the 400/0, and to a lesser extent the 360/40 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1) treatment was caused by low net assimilation at 360 and 400 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1). Plants grown at 400/0 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1) also had fewer leaves and lower chlorophyll content compared to those in other treatments. The four treatments with the smallest PPFD fluctuations produced plants with similar numbers of leaves, chlorophyll content, specific leaf area (SLA), dry mass, and leaf area. Chlorophyll content, A(n),(30), and dry mass were positively correlated with each other. Our results show that lettuce tolerates a wide range of fluctuating PPFD without negative effects on growth and development. However, when fluctuations in PPFD are extreme (400/0 or 360/40 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1)), chlorophyll levels and A(n),(30) are low, which can explain the low poor growth in these treatments. The ability of lettuce to tolerate a wide range of fluctuating light levels suggests that PPFD can be adjusted in response to variable electricity pricing.

AB  - This study analyzed interactions among photon flux density (PPFD), air temperature, root-zone temperature for growth of lettuce with non-limiting water, nutrient, and CO2 concentration. We measured growth parameters in 48 combinations of a PPFD of 200, 400, and 750 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) (16 h daylength), with air and root-zone temperatures of 20, 24, 28, and 32 degrees C. Lettuce (Lactuca sativa cv. Batavia Othilie) was grown for four cycles (29 days after transplanting). Eight combinations with low root-zone (20 and 24 degrees C), high air temperature (28 and 32 degrees C) and high PPFD (400 and 750 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) resulted in an excessive incidence of tip-burn and were not included in further analysis. Dry mass increased with increasing photon flux to a PPFD of 750 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). The photon conversion efficiency (both dry and fresh weight) decreased with increasing photon flux: 29, 27, and 21 g FW shoot and 1.01, 0.87, and 0.76 g DW shoot per mol incident light at 200, 400, and 750 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), respectively, averaged over all temperature combinations, following a concurrent decrease in specific leaf area (SLA). The highest efficiency was achieved at 200 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), 24 degrees C air temperature and 28 degrees C root-zone temperature: 44 g FW and 1.23 g DW per mol incident light. The effect of air temperature on fresh yield was linked to all leaf expansion processes. SLA, shoot mass allocation and water content of leaves showed the same trend for air temperature with a maximum around 24 degrees C. The effect of root temperature was less prominent with an optimum around 28 degrees C in nearly all conditions. With this combination of temperatures, market size (fresh weight shoot = 250 g) was achieved in 26, 20, and 18 days, at 200, 400, and 750 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), respectively, with a corresponding shoot dry matter content of 2.6, 3.8, and 4.2%. In conclusion, three factors determine the "optimal" PPFD: capital and operational costs of light intensity vs the value of reducing cropping time, and the market value of higher dry matter contents.

AB  - The effect of light intensity applied shortly before harvest on the nutritional quality, postharvest performance, and shelf life of loose-leaf lettuce (Lactuca sativa L. cv. Expertise RZ Salanova(R)) was investigated. Lettuce was grown either in a greenhouse with supplemental high-pressure sodium light (Experiment 1, EXP 1) or in a climate room under white LED light (Experiment 2, EXP 2). In both experiments full grown plants were transferred to a climate room for the End of Production (EoP) light treatments during the last week of cultivation. During EoP lighting plants were exposed to different intensities (0, 110, and 270 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) in EXP 1; 50, 210, and 470 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) in EXP 2) from white-red LEDs for 6 (EXP 2) or 7 days (EXP 1). Mature leaves were then harvested and stored in darkness at 10 degrees C to study the postharvest performance. Changes in dry matter content, total ascorbic acid, and carbohydrates (including glucose, fructose sucrose, and starch) levels were determined during EoP lighting and during the subsequent shelf life as indicators of lettuce nutritional quality. Quality aspects (appearance, texture, and odor) were accessed during the shelf life as indicators of postharvest performance. In both experiments, high light intensities applied in EoP lighting increased dry matter percentage and contents of ascorbic acid (AsA) and carbohydrates at harvest and these increased levels were maintained during the shelf life. Increased light intensity in EoP treatment also extended the shelf life. The levels of AsA and carbohydrates at harvest correlated positively with the subsequent shelf life, indicating that the prolonged shelf life relies on the improved energy and antioxidant status of the crop at harvest.

AB  - With water resources constantly becoming scarcer, and 70% of freshwater used for the agriculture sector, there is a growing need for innovative methods to increase water use efficiency (WUE) of food production systems and provide nutrient-dense food to an increasing population. Sensor technology has recently been introduced to the horticulture industry to increase resource use efficiency and minimize the environmental impacts of excessive water use. Identifying the effects of irrigation levels on crop performance is crucial for the success of sensor-based water management. This research aimed to optimize WUE in a soilless microgreen production system through identification of an optimal irrigation level using a sensor that could facilitate the development of a more efficient, low-cost automated irrigation system. A dielectric moisture sensor was implemented to monitor water levels at five irrigation setpoints: 7.5, 17.5, 25, 30, and 35 percent of the effective volume of the container (EVC) during a 14-day growth cycle. To validate the sensor performance, the same irrigation levels were applied to a parallel trial, without sensor, and water levels were monitored gravimetrically. Plant water status and stress reaction were evaluated using infrared thermal imaging, and the accumulation of osmolytes (proline) was determined. Results showed that, proline concentration, canopy temperature (Tc), canopy temperature depression (CTD), and crop water stress index (CWSI) increased at 7.5% EVC in both sensor-based and gravimetric treatments, and infrared index (Ig) and fresh yield decreased. The dielectric moisture sensor was effective in increasing WUE. The irrigation level of 17.5% EVC was found to be optimal. It resulted in a WUE of 88 g/L, an improvement of 30% over the gravimetric method at the same irrigation level. Furthermore, fresh yield increased by 11.5%. The outcome of this study could contribute to the automation of precision irrigation in hydroponically grown microgreens.

AB  - Shorter photoperiod and lower daily light integral (DLI) limit the winter greenhouse production. Extending the photoperiod by supplemental light increases biomass production but inhibits flowering in short-day plants such as Chrysanthemum morifolium. Previously, we reported that flowering in growth-chamber grown chrysanthemum with red (R) and blue (B) LED-light could also be induced in long photoperiods by applying only blue light during the last 4h of 15h long-days. This study investigates the possibility to induce flowering by extending short-days in greenhouses with 4h of blue light. Furthermore, flower induction after 4h of red light extension was tested after short-days RB-LED light in a growth-chamber and after natural solar light in a greenhouse. Plants were grown at 11h of sole source RB light (60:40) in a growth-chamber or solar light in the greenhouse (short-days). Additionally, plants were grown under long-days, which either consisted of short-days as described above extended with 4h of B or R light to long-days or of 15h continuous RB light or natural solar light. Flower initiation and normal capitulum development occurred in the blue-extended long-days in the growth-chamber after 11h of sole source RB, similarly as in short-days. However, when the blue extension was applied after 11h of full-spectrum solar light in a greenhouse, no flower initiation occurred. With red-extended long-days after 11h RB (growth-chamber) flower initiation occurred, but capitulum development was hindered. No flower initiation occurred in red-extended long-days in the greenhouse. These results indicate that multiple components of the daylight spectrum influence different phases in photoperiodic flowering in chrysanthemum in a time-dependent manner. This research shows that smart use of LED-light can open avenues for a more efficient year-round cultivation of chrysanthemum by circumventing the short-day requirement for flowering when applied in emerging vertical farm or plant factories that operate without natural solar light. In current year-round greenhouses' production, however, extension of the natural solar light during the first 11 h of the photoperiod with either red or blue sole LED light, did inhibit flowering.

AB  - The economic viability and energy use of vertical farms strongly depend on the efficiency of the use of light. Increasing far-red radiation (FR, 700-800 nm) relative to photosynthetically active radiation (PAR, 400-700 nm) may induce shade avoidance responses including stem elongation and leaf expansion, which would benefit light interception, and FR might even be photosynthetically active when used in combination with PAR. The aims of this study are to investigate the interaction between FR and planting density and to quantify the underlying components of the FR effects on growth. Lettuce (Lactuca sativa cv. Expertise RZ) was grown in a climate chamber under two FR treatments (0 or 52 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) and three planting densities (23, 37, and 51 plants m(-2)). PAR of 89% red and 11% blue was kept at 218 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). Adding FR increased plant dry weight after 4 weeks by 46-77% (largest effect at lowest planting density) and leaf area by 58-75% (largest effect at middle planting density). Radiation use efficiency (RUE: plant dry weight per unit of incident radiation, 400-800 nm) increased by 17-42% and incident light use efficiency (LUEinc: plant dry weight per unit of incident PAR, 400-700 nm) increased by 46-77% by adding FR; the largest FR effects were observed at the lowest planting density. Intercepted light use efficiency (LUEint: plant dry weight per unit of intercepted PAR) increased by adding FR (8-23%). Neither specific leaf area nor net leaf photosynthetic rate was influenced by FR. We conclude that supplemental FR increased plant biomass production mainly by faster leaf area expansion, which increased light interception. The effects of FR on plant dry weight are stronger at low than at high planting density. Additionally, an increased LUEint may contribute to the increased biomass production.

AB  - Altering the radiation intensity in controlled environments can influence volatile organic compound (VOC) biosynthetic pathways, including those of terpenoids and phenylpropanoids. In turn, the concentrations of these compounds can have a profound effect on flavor and sensory attributes. Because sweet basil (Ocimum basilicum) is a popular culinary herb, our objectives were to (1) determine the extent radiation intensity and carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration influence seedling terpenoid and phenylpropanoid concentrations; (2) determine if differences in phenylpropanoid and terpenoid concentrations influence consumer preference; and (3) characterize consumer preferences to better inform production and marketing strategies. "Nufar" sweet basil was grown with CO2 concentrations of 500 or 1,000 mu mol . mol(-1) under sole-source radiation intensities of 100, 200, 400, or 600 mu mol . m(-2) . s(-1) with a 16 h photoperiod to create daily light integrals of 6, 12, 23, and 35 mol . m(-2) . d(-1). After 2 weeks, concentrations of the terpenoids 1,8 cineole and linalool and the phenylpropanoids eugenol and methyl chavicol were quantified, and consumer sensory panel evaluations were conducted to quantify preferences. Overall, increasing radiation intensity from 100 to 600 mu mol . m(-2) . s(-1) increased 1,8 cineole, linalool, and eugenol concentrations 2. 4-, 8. 8-, and 3.3-fold, respectively, whereas CO2 concentration did not influence VOCs. Contrary to our hypothesis, increased VOC concentrations were not correlated with consumer preference. However, overall liking was correlated with aftertaste and flavor. The conclusion that consumer preference is dependent on flavor can be drawn. However, increasing VOC concentrations to increase flavor did not improve flavor preference. Many consumer sensory preference characteristics (favorable preference for aftertaste, bitterness/sweetness, color, flavor, overall liking, and texture) were correlated with basil grown under a radiation intensity of 200 mu mol . m(-2) . s(-1). This led us to determine that consumers prefer to detect the characteristic basil flavor made up of 1,8 cineole, eugenol, and linalool, which was not as prevalent in basil grown under 100 mu mol . m(-2) . s(-1), but too high in basil grown under 400 and 600 mu mol . m(-2) . s(-1), which led to lower consumer preference.

AB  - To investigate the effects of red and blue light on potato growth and yield, potato plantlets were transplanted under white (W), red (R), blue (B), and red + blue (RB; 50%R + 50%B) light in growth chambers. Plants under W had a significantly lower tuber yield per plant than the other treatments, although their shoot dry weights were the highest among all treatments. Potato plants under R had the highest tuber yield per plant among all treatments. The distribution of tuber yield under R showed a lower ratio of 2-20 g tubers and a higher ratio of > 20 g tubers, compared to tubers under W. Plants under R had greater leaf dry weight and slowly decreasing total leaf area compared to other treatments in the late stage of potato growth, thereby extending active tuber bulking under R. Although plants under B and RB did not significantly differ in tuber yield per plant, tuber bulking under B and RB occurred in different ways. Plants under RB advanced tuberization in the seedling stage, while tubers under B rapidly accumulated biomass in the medium stage. Plants under B had higher sucrose transport from leaves to sinks and stronger tuberization signals in tubers than those under W. Tubers under B had significantly increased levels of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase and sucrose synthase to promote starch biosynthesis, compared to tubers under W. Overall, red light increased tuber biomass accumulation, while blue light rapidly promoted tuber bulking.

AB  - We used two types of Ocimum basilicum plants and white light-emitting diode (LED) lights as controls (plant factory unit 1, PFU 1). We applied four composite LED light treatments, 125:125:125 white, red, blue (PFU 2), 0.0:250:125 white, red, blue (PFU 3), 125:125:57 white, red, blue (PFU 4) and 125:57:125 white, red, blue (PFU 5) to evaluate light quality effects on antioxidant capacity of 0. basilicum plants. The results revealed that the composite lights of PFUs 2,3,4 and 5 were beneficial for the accumulation of flavonoids and glutathione but were not beneficial for the proanthocyanidin content; the plants subjected to the PFUs 2,3,4 and 5 treatments had a higher laccase activity and proline content and a lower malondialdehyde (MDA) content, polyphenol oxidase activity and peroxidase activity than the control plants.Analysis via high-performance liquid chromatography revealed that protocatechuic acid, gentisic acid, chlorogenic acid, syringic acid, cinnamic acid, quercetin, apigenin, kaempferol, chrysin, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, p-coumaric acid, apigenin-7-glucoside, rutin, rosmarinic acid were the major phenolic components in the O. Basilicum extracts, and sufficient composite lighting of O. basilicum plants significantly enhanced these antioxidant concentrations. Our results indicate that the use of LEDs with different light qualities to irradiate O. basilicum significantly improved the antioxidant capacity which could be a beneficial for nutrition and health benefits.

AB  - With a growing world population and the concentration of citizens in big cities new methods of agriculture are required. Vertical farming attracts more attention in mending these growing problems. To enable a widespread use of low-cost hydroponic systems this study investigates minimal requirements for plants (different herbs and vegetables) in such a hydroponic vertical farming system and the suitability of textiles as sustainable substrates. Therefore, this study aims to investigate plant stress levels, germination rates and water usage in a low-cost hydroponic system with no special lightning in principle comparison with indoor cultivation in soil. The results of the pulse-amplitude-modulation (PAM) measurements as measure of photosynthetic performance indicate that the plants were equally stressed in hydroponic and in soil cultivation. In this respect, the photosynthetic quantum yield in both cultivation systems is on average only slightly lower than the values expected under optimal conditions. It was observed that chive and lovage not only had a significantly higher germination rate in the hydroponic system but also accumulated significantly more fresh as well as dry biomass, while spinach, thyme and marjoram showed higher germination rates in soil cultivation. The water consumption in the setup was considerably higher for the hydroponic system compared to indoor soil cultivation.

AB  - The emerging industry of vertical farming (VF) faces three key challenges: standardisation, environmental sustainability, and profitability. High failure rates are costly and can stem from premature business decisions about location choice, pricing strategy, system design, and other critical issues. Improving knowledge transfer and developing adaptable economic analysis for VF is necessary for profitable business models to satisfy investors and policy makers. A review of current horticultural software identifies a need for a decision support system (DSS) that facilitates risk-empowered business planning for vertical farmers. Data from the literature alongside lessons learned from industry practitioners are centralised in the proposed DSS, using imprecise data techniques to accommodate for partial information. The DSS evaluates business sustainability using financial risk assessment. This is necessary for complex/new sectors such as VF with scarce data.

AB  - This paper is dedicated to studying the nutrition, health status and food provision of the people living the northern regions of Russia. The authors developed a concept of comprehensive interdisciplinary research of traditional and innovative behavioral practices of actors in the northern regions of Russia in the field of food production and consumption in order to study the structure of nutrition of the population, its health status and the technologies that are used to provide the people with food products. The interdisciplinary comprehensive research applied the following methods: (a) statistical method; (b) sociological method of mass survey; (c) sociological method of expert interviews; (d) method of feasibility study; (e) method of mathematical modeling. According to the results of the analysis, the nutrition of the people living in the norther regions is characterized by insufficient consumption of fresh vegetables, meat and processed meat, fish and seafood, milk and dairy products, some vitamins and bio-elements (such as selenium, calcium) and excessive consumption of saturated fats and flour products. The following problems related to providing the population of the northern regions of Russia with food products were identified: the agriculture in almost all northern regions of Russia has negative profitability; imported food products and food ingredients are mostly used; there are drawbacks of logistics, transportation and storage of food products; the natural and climate conditions are unfavorable for traditional agriculture. The paper substantiates the economic, environmental, social, and political advantages of highly automated agro-industrial complex of vertical farming as an alternative method for providing food security of the inhabitants of the northern regions of Russia.

AB  - A growing population needs an expansion of agriculture to ensure a reliable supply of nutritious food. As a variable concept, vertical farming, becoming increasingly popular, can allow plant growth for local food production in the vertical sense on, e.g. facades in addition to the classical layered structure in buildings. As substrates, textile fabrics can be used as a sustainable approach in terms of reusability. In our experiment, we investigated which properties a textile should possess in order to be suitable for an application in vertical farming by the example of cress seeds. To determine the best-fitted fabric, four different textiles were mounted vertically, and were provided with controlled irrigation and illumination. Our results showed that a hairy textile surface as provided by weft-knitted plush is advantageous. There, the rooting of cress plants used in this experiment is easier and less complicated than along tightly meshed, flat surfaces, as for woven linen fabrics.

AB  - Traditional agriculture has to face different climatic factors, resulting in unstable crop yields, whereas a plant factory is indoors, thus avoiding different natural disasters and insect pests. It is also available for bulk production in all-weather all year-round, guaranteeing crop quality. This study uses a wireless sensor network (WSN) architecture for multi-monitoring of a plant environment, aiming to improve its growing environment quality. In terms of monitoring environment, the sensor modules at the end device nodes are combined with Arduino for capturing the sensor values, which are transmitted by wireless signal transmission. The data of wireless signals are further transmitted by multiple end devices XBee to the coordinator XBee. The coordinator is in charge of collecting data, which are transferred via a Com port to the monitoring-end computer; the system interface classifies the sensing data and displays the sensor values on the screen; at the same time, the sense data are transferred to the Access database and stored. The sensor values are uploaded to a Cloud hard disk database MySQL, and real-time environment data can be seen on webpage. In terms of control, whenever an abnormal warning occurs as the environment sensing value exceeds the preset plant growing condition, the system interface displays a warning and transfers a wireless control signal via WSN to the control module of the terminal node. The electric apparatus is actuated when the control instruction is received to improve the environmental quality, until the abnormal warning stops, and the operation stops. There is an additional time setting function, whereby the user can set the sprinkling and lighting-up time in the system interface, so that at the present time, the program sends an instruction to the controller to activate the designated action. According to multiple experimental analyses, the combination of Arduino and XBee is applicable to different scenarios, such as an environmental monitoring system and an interaction with scenario, even robot making Different wireless sensor applications can be constructed, so that the users can make further WSN technology development and innovations based on the results of this study.

AB  - The market for biopharmaceuticals is dominated by recombinant proteins and is driven mainly by the development of vaccines and antibodies. Manufacturing predominantly relies on fermentation-based production platforms, which have limited scalability and suffer from high upstream process costs. As an alternative, the production of recombinant proteins in whole plants (plant molecular farming) provides a scalable and cost efficient upstream process because each plant functions as a self-contained bioreactor, avoiding costs associated with single-use devices and cleaning-in-place. Despite many proof-of-concept studies and the approval of a few products as medical devices, the only approved pharmaceutical proteins manufactured in whole plants have been authorized under emergency protocols. The absence of approvals under standard clinical development pathways in part reflects the lack of standardized process equipment and unit operations, leading to industry inertia based on familiarity with fermenter systems. Here we discuss the upstream production steps of plant molecular farming by transient expression in intact plants, including seeding, plant cultivation, infiltration with Agrobacterium tumefaciens, post-infiltration incubation, and harvesting. We focus on cultivation techniques because they strongly affect the subsequent steps and overall process design. We compare the benefits and drawbacks of open field, greenhouse and vertical farm strategies in terms of upfront investment costs, batch reproducibility, and decoupling from environmental impacts. We consider process automation, monitoring and adaptive process design in the context of Industry 4.0, which can boost process efficiency and batch-to-batch uniformity to improve regulatory compliance. Finally, we discuss the costs-benefit aspects of the different cultivation systems.

AB  - Production of safe food in the densely populated areas of the developing countries is the most challenging issue due to the speedy urbanization, fragile food transportation facilities, and reduced farmlands. Given this background, a study was conducted to evaluate the agronomic properties and economic viability of lettuce grown vertically in the wall of building in Dhaka city, Bangladesh. Two lettuce cultivars (V1: Green wave and V2: New red fire) and three organic growing media (P1: 40% soil + 40% vermicompost + 20% coir; P2: 50% soil + 50% vermicompost; P3: 20% soil + 40% vermicompost + 40% spent mushroom compost) along with control (P0:100% soil) were used. The results revealed that plant height, leaf area, fresh weight, dry weight, and total yield of leaf lettuce were significantly increased when the green-leafed cultivar (VI) was grown in the P1 compared to all other treatments, but V2 got maximum sensory attribute scores when grown in the P1. Lettuce leaves grown in the formulated growing media (P1, P2, and P3) had higher microbial infestation whereas, a lower content occurred in the P0. The higher economic return was observed in V1P1. These results provided baseline information for further study on urban commercial vertical farming on the building walls. These demonstrate the agronomic and economic potential for vertical farming in densely populated areas but emphasize the need for optimized food safety strategies.

AB  - In contrast to fluorescent lamps and high-power sodium lamps, the use of light-emitting diode (LED) lamps enables the control of not only photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) at the plant level, but also the relative spectral photon flux density distribution (RSPD) of light because of the variet, even at different times of day, of producible light emitted by LEDs of different types. Effects of the spectral photon flux density on plant growth and morphology have been investigated using several types of LEDs and plant species. However, few studies on lighting methods with time-varying PPFD or RSPD have been published to date. In this paper, we summarize the effects of time-varying PPFD on the net photosynthetic rate (P-n) and those of time-varying RSPD on plant growth and morphology. Detailed modeling studies have been conducted on the reactions of the photosynthetic pathway under time-varying PPFD at a cycle of milliseconds to seconds. The results of these modeling studies and actual measurements of P-n under pulsed light clearly indicate that pulsed light is not advantageous to improve P-n. Although the integrated PPFD of blue and red light was unchanged, the growth of leaf lettuce was promoted by asynchronous irradiation with blue light and red light compared with growth under simultaneous irradiation. We think that blue-light monochromatic irradiation promotes leaf elongation through leaf expansion as a primary factor in the enhancement of plant growth. In addition, changes in leaf photosynthetic capacity caused by blue-light monochromatic irradiation may be involved in plant growth promotion. An increasing number of studies have investigated the effects of time-varying RSPD on plants. However, the mechanisms underlying these effects remain to be elucidated.

   The presented analysis allows one to evaluate the use of rainwater for the purposes of watering plants for indoor cultivation halls potentially located in Wroclaw (Poland, Lower Silesia).
   The aim of this study was to determine the suitability of a rainwater harvesting system to cover the water demand for indoor hydroponic lettuce cultivation located in Wroclaw (Poland). The analysis was performed on the basis of the recorded rainfall in Wroclaw in 2000-2019. The analyzed cultivation is located in a hall with an area of 300 m(2), where the lettuce is grown vertically by the hydroponic method. The calculations of the rainwater harvesting (RWH) system were carried out considering the selection of the tank capacity for the collected water. The operation of the water storage is simulated using a yield after spillage (YAS) algorithm. It was evident that the proposed system might be an auxiliary system that relieves the water supply network or supports other water recovery systems (e.g., the water vapor condensation in a cross-flow heat exchanger operating as an element of the air conditioning system, proposed in Part 1 of this study). The harvesting system for the selected vertical farming indoor hall covers an average of 35.9% of water needs and allows a saving of 146,510 L of water annually for the cultivation. An average water demand coverage increases up to 90.4%, which allows a saving of 340,300 L per year when the RWH system is combined with water recovery from exhaust air from the hall.

AB  - To design a novel plug tray for ginseng seedling production, the effects of cell height and diameter, which determine root-zone volume, on growth and morphology of ginseng seedlings were investigated. Stratified seeds of the cultivar 'Chunpoong' were sown into containers with different cell heights (150, 200, 250, and 300 mm) with a diameter of 50 mm, denoted as H150, H200, H250, and H300, and different cell diameters (15, 20, 30, 50, and 75 mm) with a height of 200 mm, denoted as D15, D20, D30, D50, and D75, and filled with commercial growing media. Seedlings were then grown for 20 weeks in an ebb-and-flow subirrigation system installed in a plant factory with artificial light. Fresh and dry weights, length of roots, and leaf area increased as the cell height increased up to 300 mm. Length, fresh and dry weights of both shoots and roots, root diameter, and leaf area all increased as the cell diameter increased up to 30 mm. The root diameter was not significantly different between D30 and D75, though the roots had more space to expand. A further increase in cell height and diameter beyond H200 or D30 was not effective at increasing plant growth. The roots of ginseng seedlings were long and thick in the cells with a height of 200 mm and diameter of 30 mm. As a result, a novel plug tray was developed with a height and diameter of 200 mm and 30 mm, respectively, resulting in a root volume of 141.37 mL and planting density of 1,156 seedlings/m(2) (9 cm(2)/plants).

AB  - Light is one of the five indispensable factors for plant growth. Green houses and plant factories have advantages of growing vegetables off-season and high production. However, artificial lighting occupies most of the running cost during the operation of plant factories, and intelligent and programmable light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have been considered to be used as growing lamps to save energy. Taking both the photosynthetic and the visual performances into consideration, luminescent spectrum of LEDs based on quantum dot (QD) materials is designed and optimized according to the photosynthetic action spectrum (PAS) of plants. In our calculation, the three-band QD-based LEDs (QLEDs) show a highest photosynthetic action factor (PAF) of 8.088 and a highest induced photosynthetic index (IPI) of 4.012. The four-band QLEDs show a highest PAF of 7.689 and a highest IPI of 3.818. CdZnS/ZnS and CdZnS/ZnSe QDs are also synthesized for fabricating three- and four-band QLEDs. Investigations of the photosynthetic and the vison performances on these devices are consistent with those theoretical simulation results. Both the simulation and the experimental results show that either the three- or the four-band QLEDs has better photosynthetic parameters than those of the conventional light sources. The fabricated four-band QLED under different applied current exhibits a highest PAF of 2.6942 and a highest IPI of 1.3621. For the vison performances, the four-band device demonstrate a highest CRI of 93 and a highest CCT of 2053 K. Despite the visual performances of the four-band QLEDs show improvement than those of the three-band ones, they still need to be improved to offer better visual experience for human eyes. With further investigation on the synthesis of emission tunable QD materials and the optimization of the spectrum, highly efficient QLEDs with both good photosynthetic and visual performances are expected to be applied in the field of growing lamps.

AB  - The modern food supply faces many challenges. The global population continues to grow and people are becoming wealthier, so the food production system must respond by creating enough high-quality food to feed everyone with minimal damage to our environment. The number of people suffering or dying from diet-related chronic diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and cancer, continues to rise, which is partly linked to overconsumption of highly processed foods, especially high-calorie or rapidly digestible foods. After falling for many years, the number of people suffering from starvation or malnutrition is rising, and this has been exacerbated by the global COVID-19 pandemic. The highly integrated food supply chains that spread around the world are susceptible to disruptions due to policy changes, economic stresses, and natural disasters, as highlighted by the recent pandemic.
   In this perspective article, written by members of the Editorial Committee of the Annual Review of Food Science and Technology, we highlight some of the major challenges confronting the modern food supply chain as well as how innovations in policy and technology can be used to address them. Pertinent technological innovations include robotics, machine learning, artificial intelligence, advanced diagnostics, nanotechnology, biotechnology, gene editing, vertical farming, and soft matter physics. Many of these technologies are already being employed across the food chain by farmers, distributors, manufacturers, and consumers to improve the quality, nutrition, safety, and sustainability of the food supply. These innovations are required to stimulate the development and implementation of new technologies to ensure a more equitable, resilient, and efficient food production system. Where appropriate, these technologies should be carefully tested before widespread implementation so that proper risk-benefit analyses can be carried out. They can then be employed without causing unforeseen adverse consequences. Finally, it is important to actively engage all stakeholders involved in the food supply chain throughout the development and testing of these new technologies to support their adoption if proven safe and effective.

AB  - To evaluate the usefulness of green light in artificial lighting cultivation, the effects of green light supplementation to a mixture of blue and red light on growth and photosynthesis in leaf lettuce (Lactuca sativa L. 'Green-wave') grown at three different planting densities (33, 44 and 55 plants m(-2)) were investigated. Plants were grown under a mixture of red, green and blue light (RGB; red/green/blue light intensity ratio of 2/1/1) or a mixture of red and blue light (RB; red/ blue light intensity ratio of 3/1), at 200 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) for two weeks.
   At 44 plants m(-2), the shoot fresh weight under ROB was significantly lower than that under RB, which was due to the decrease in the leaf number. There was no difference in the shoot fresh weight between the light treatments at 33 and 55 plants m(-2). Chlorophyll and ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase contents in the lower leaves were significantly higher under RGB than under RB conditions. These data indicated that increases in these components did not lead to improving of the growth under the RGB condition compared with the RB condition, while green light irradiation could be valuable in suppressing leaf senescence of the lower leaves of Green-wave. We evaluated green light as useful because it reduces the waste of leaf blades in the pre-shipment trimming process.

AB  - The recent statistical data and market studies have shown that the microgreens market is on a continuously upward trend in Europe and globally due to their healthier and nutritious qualities and for fast adoption of indoor and vertical farming especially in the cities. Worldwide the microgreens become of great interest due to their benefits for people's health and beauty, being 40 times more nutritious than mature vegetables, increasing also the amount of available space that might be put into food production, with environmental benefits and economic profitability. The evolution of microgreens market to its real development potential depends of consumers behaviour and income level. Microgreens are considered 'desert food' by their huge potential to provide food in marginal areas affected by climate change becoming a part of sustainable farming. The present study pursued the evaluation of microgreens global market trends and forward statements in order to identify them as a potential profitable business in the era of Covid 19 pandemic when farmers should adapt food production to the new economic and social contexts. The study showed an increased consumer interest for "healthy" products, so that the change according to their behaviour shall generate an increase in the microgreens market worldwide.

AB  - Use of the appropriate propagule size can maximize the propagation rate of strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa) transplants in an autotrophic transplant production method, a novel propagation method in a plant factory with artificial lighting for transplant production. During 90 days after planting the initial propagules, the cumulative number of transplants produced from propagules with a 5 mm crown diameter (CD5) was greater than those produced from propagules with a 4 mm crown diameter (CD4) or a 6 mm crown diameter (CD6). Timescales of propagation cycles (required timescale to produce new propagules; the sum of the time from planting propagules to the emergence of runners and the time from the emergence of runners to the separation of runner plants) of first, second, and third runner plants in CD5 were 2.1 - 20.7% shorter than those in CD4 or CD6. In second and third runner plants, the time from planting propagules to emergence of runners increased as propagule crown diameter decreased; however, the time from emergence of runners to separation of a runner plant decreased as crown diameter decreased. The fluctuation of the timescales of propagation cycles with propagation generation in CD5 was smaller than those in CD4 and CD6. After separating runner plants from their propagules, the number of leaves in CD5 fluctuated less than those in CD4 and CD6. These results indicate that propagules having a 5 mm crown diameter and two leaves are appropriate for the autotrophic transplant production method of strawberry in a plant factory.

AB  - Lettuce exposed to red (R) and blue (B) LEDs (4R:1B, 200 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1)) were cultivated hydroponically in an environmentally controlled plant factory to examine the effects of light-dark cycle (LDC) conversion at pre-harvest stage on the growth, phytochemical, and photosynthetic pigment accumulation of lettuce. Lettuce plants of four groups were firstly cultivated with the same LDC of 16/8 h (light/dark) for fourteen days. Six days before harvest, the LDC of three groups were altered to 8/4 h (T12), 24/12 h (T36), and 32/16 h (T48), respectively. The last group had invariable photoperiod and was concerned as control (CK, 16/8 h). The results showed that T12 and T36 significantly improved while T48 reduced leaf area and shoot fresh and dry weight of lettuce compared with the CK. The plants treated with altered LDC had higher phytochemicals (soluble sugar, soluble protein, and ascorbate) and photosynthetic pigments (chlorophyll and carotenoids) contents than the CK, but the starch and nitrate contents of the CK were higher. These results suggested that the yield and nutritional quality of lettuce can be increased by changing the LDC properly in the later growth stage. But if the light-dark period was too long, it would have negative effects on the growth of lettuce. In addition, shorten the LDC at pre-harvest stage promoted better production yield and nutritional quality based on the same electricity consumption.

AB  - Green perilla (Perilla frutescens var. crispa) is a highly functional Japanese herb. We investigated the growth of green perilla along with the levels of perillaldehyde, beta-carotene, lutein, and rosmarinic acid in the plant when UV-A, blue light, and far-red light were additionally irradiated with red light to confirm the control technology using LED light to produce high-quality green perilla in plant factories efficiently. Twenty-eight-day-old seedlings of green perilla cultivated under white fluorescent lamps were transplanted to a hydroponic culture apparatus. The plants were subjected to different light treatments (red, red and UV-A, red and blue, and red and far-red light) and cultivated for more than 20 days. Perillaldehyde, beta-carotene, lutein, and rosmarinic acid contents were quantified using an HPLC system during harvesting. It was observed that top fresh weight, plant height, leaf area attached to the main stem, fresh stem weight, and dry weight of leaves and stems were the highest under red plus far-red light among all light treatments. Addition of blue or far-red to red light did not affect perillaldehyde, lutein, beta-carotene, and rosmarinic acid concentrations in green perilla. Irradiation with red plus UV-A light tended to increase the carotenoid concentration and decrease the rosmarinic acid concentration in green perilla, compared with red light only. To cultivate green perilla with high rosmarinic acid concentration, irradiation with only red light is effective, and to cultivate green perilla with high carotenoid concentration, red light supplemented with UV-A is effective.

AB  - This study discussed the influence of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) with red, blue, green, and yellow light on the growth and photosynthetic efficiency of Boston lettuce and Ziyan lettuce as a reference for lettuce production in plant factories. The experiments were conducted in a plant factory under a 120 mu mole.m(-2).s(-1) photosynthetic photon flux density, CO2 concentration of 1000 ppm, and daytime and nighttime temperature of 25 degrees C/18 h and 17 degrees C/6 h, respectively. The experiment results revealed that after 15 days of treatment under different spectral qualities, the appearances of the two lettuce leaves differed slightly. The fresh and dry weights of the Boston lettuce were highest under green light treatment. The fresh and dry weights of the Ziyan lettuce were higher under red and green light, and blue light helped the leaves to change color. In addition, photosynthesis analyzers were used to investigate the photosynthetic efficiency of the two types of lettuce under the four spectral qualities under the six luminous intensity levels of 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, and 120 mu mole.m(-2).s(-1) and six CO2 concentrations of 400, 600, 800, 1000, 1200, and 1400 ppm. The photosynthetic efficiency of the two types of lettuce generally increased with increasing luminous intensity and CO2 concentration. When the luminous intensity was 100 and 120 mu mole.m(-2).s-(1) and the CO2 concentration was 1200 ppm and 1400 ppm, the Boston lettuce had the highest photosynthetic efficiency under green light. When luminous intensity was 120 mu mole.m(-2).s(-1) and the CO2 concentration was over 1000 ppm, the Ziyan lettuce had the highest photosynthetic efficiency under red light. These results revealed that the monochromatic LED light most suitable for growth differed across types of lettuce. In this experiment, the yield and photosynthetic efficiency of Boston lettuce were highest under green light. Those of Ziyan lettuce were highest under red light.

AB  - Four cultivars of June-bearing strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa Duch.) were grown under controlled environmental conditions to determine the optimum air temperature in the light period for fruit production in a plant factory with artificial lighting. The air temperature in the dark period was set at 7 degrees C, and at 22 or 27 degrees C in the light period. Fruit were harvested continuously for 30 weeks. The fast day fruit harvested tended to be earlier at 27 degrees C than at 22 degrees C for all cultivars. The marketable fruit yield was significantly higher at 22 degrees C for 'Sachinoka' whereas it was higher at 27 degrees C for 'Tochiotome.' The soluble solid content (SSC) of the early harvested fruit was significantly higher at 22 degrees C than at 27 degrees C for all cultivars. The SSC of the late harvested fruit was significantly higher at 27 degrees C for only 'Tochiotome.' Regadless of cultivar, fruit firmness was significantly higher at 22 degrees C. The results of this study indicated that 22 degrees C is better than 27 degrees C for the air temperature in the light period during the production of strawberry fruit under controlled conditions, except for 'Tochiotome; which may be a suitable cultivar for fruit production at relatively high air temperatures.

AB  - There is an ongoing debate about the role of controlled environment agriculture and containerized food production in local food systems in Northern North American communities. Some critics dismiss these applications as ineffective, arguing that because they marginalize certain populations they do not have a place in northern food systems. However, such critiques are premature and undermine what may prove to be an important and complementary component of local and regional food systems in the north, particularly if designed and implemented in a culturally appropriate and placebased context. Containerized food production can offer enhanced food production capabilities for communities through year-round production. While there are still concerns about proper growing protocols, scalability, output, durability, and economics, these can be addressed, modified and improved through research and continued applications. New opportunities requiring further exploration in the application of containerized food production systems include, but are not limited to, integrative systems design, the enhancement of community development initiatives, and the integration of the social networks that are necessary for diversified local food production.

AB  - A closed-type plant factory (plant factory) can control growth environments in confined spaces with artificial lights and hydroponic systems. The growth environment of a plant factory can be modulated without having to consider the natural climate, so that high value plants rich in useful compounds or low in toxic compounds can be uniformly and consistently produced. However, the process of optimizing growth condition settings to increase or decrease the target compounds tends to be complicated, given the various control parameters in a plant factory. An efficient optimization process for producing high value plants was shown using physiological and genetic information in the case of Stevia rebaudiana (stevia). This case study was conducted to determine the optimal conditions for producing stevia rich in sweet steviol glycosides (SGs) compounds. All environmental condition settings were selected based on previous studies relating to the biosynthesis of such SGs as stevioside (Stev) or rebaudioside-A (Reb-A). A yield evaluation of Stev and Reb-A was conducted based on the transcription levels of SGs-related genes. The process of producing SGs-rich stevia provides an example of an efficient optimization process for producing high value plants with increased or decreased target compounds in a plant factory system.

AB  - Tomato is a globally strategic crop and consumers need it throughout the year. To have a healthy and productive tomato plant, a high-quality seedling is a necessity. Toward this end, the current research was to improve a system for producing tomato seedlings in plant factories using light-emitting diodes (LEDs). The results indicated that tomato seedlings of both cultivars under (Red 70% + Blue 30%) showed the greatest plant height and the largest total leaf area. The best treatment for the accumulation of soluble protein and soluble sugar contents for Gangmu No.1 and Millennium cultivars were (Red 50%+Green 20%+ Blue 30%) and Red 100%, respectively. The Non-Photochemical Quenching under (Red 50%+Green 20%+ Blue 30%) treatment was the lowest for Gangmu No.1, while it was the lowest under white fluorescent light for Millennium. The electron transport rate under white fluorescent light treatment was the highest for Gangmu No.1, while it was the highest under (Red 70% + Blue 30%) for Millennium. The results indicated that the mixture of red and blue at (Red 70% + Blue 30%) was beneficial for the growth of tomato seedlings for both cultivars, which could be efficiently used in plant factories and provide some data for different LED light ratios applicable in a closed system to demonstrate how to get the best lighting conditions for tomato seedlings.

However, it also receives many doubts about using excessive energy to support its artificial lighting system. In this paper, a solar-based vertical greenhouse is investigated based on a baseline greenhouse configuration. Ray tracing method is utilized to simulate the solar energy delivered to crop surfaces through window glasses transmission and artificially from a sunlight guiding system. Simulated results demonstrated that elevating the floor height and introducing a sunlight guiding system can improve the sunlight amount without using artificial lighting.

AB  - Victory onion (Allium victorialis) is an edible vegetation that has significant value as a non-structural carbohydrate and secondary metabolite supplier. Easily measured leaf variables will be useful to predict for the flexible adjustment of physiochemical parameters in a cultural regime in plant factory conditions. Red, green, and blue light-emitting diode (LED) spectra were used to culture victory onion sprouts. Compared to the green-light spectrum, the red-light spectrum promoted leaf width and area, specific leaf area, and dry mass, water content, fine root growth, and starch accumulation in shoots, but lowered concentrations of total flavonoids and saponins. Sprouts had their shoots cut, but there were limited interactive effects with light spectra on most variables. In general, shoot-cutting depressed growth of leaf morphology, shoot weight, water content, and soluble sugar content, but enhanced accumulation of secondary metabolites. We did not find any relationship between leaf variables and secondary metabolites. Instead, wider leaves with a larger area generally had greater dry mass, water content, and soluble sugar accumulation. Leaves with deeper green colours generally had the opposite effects.

AB  - In vertical farming, plants are grown in multi-layered growth chambers supplied with energy-efficient LEDs that produce less heat and can thus be placed in close proximity to the plants. The spectral quality control allowed by LED lighting potentially enables steering plant development toward desired phenotypes. However, this requires detailed knowledge on how light quality affects different developmental processes per plant species or even cultivar, and how well information from model plants translates to horticultural crops. Here we have grown the model dicot Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) and the crop plant Solanum lycopersicum (tomato) under white or monochromatic red or blue LED conditions. In addition, seedlings were grown in vitro in either light-grown roots (LGR) or dark-grown roots (DGR) LED conditions. Our results present an overview of phenotypic traits that are sensitive to red or blue light, which may be used as a basis for application by tomato nurseries. Our comparative analysis showed that young tomato plants were remarkably indifferent to the LED conditions, with red and blue light effects on primary growth, but not on organ formation or flowering. In contrast, Arabidopsis appeared to be highly sensitive to light quality, as dramatic differences in shoot and root elongation, organ formation, and developmental phase transitions were observed between red, blue, and white LED conditions. Our results highlight once more that growth responses to environmental conditions can differ significantly between model and crop species. Understanding the molecular basis for this difference will be important for designing lighting systems tailored for specific crops.

AB  - Pigmented food are an important part of the human diet, and anthocyanins have demonstrable protection against tumor production in mouse models and beneficial effects on human liver chemistry. As such, producing pigmented crops is important for a nutritionally diverse diet. Lollo rosso lettuce is a fast-growing pigmented plant, is rich in phenolic compounds, and represents a suitable system to test optimization strategies for yield and anthocyanin production. High-energy UV wavebands are often used to stimulate increased pigmentation; however, we hypothesized that optimizing visible wavebands would deliver both yield and quality improvements. Growing Lollo rosso under irradiances between 5 and 180 W m(-2) using visible waveband LEDs produced 0.4 g fresh weight per W m(-2) in the linear portion of the curve between 5 and 40 W m(-2) and achieved an approximate asymptote of 20 g fresh weight at around 100-120 W m(-2) for yield. Anthocyanin content increased linearly with irradiance. We attempted to optimize the visible wavebands by supplementing half the asymptotic energy for 15 days with supplemental red (R) or blue (B) wavebands in the peaks of photosynthetic activity (430-460 and 630-660 nm). R and B affected rosette morphology with no significant impact on yield, but B significantly increased anthocyanin content by 94% compared to R. We therefore focused on further optimizing B by shortening the daily duration of supplemental B. The minimum B treatment that lacked significant pigment induction was 1 h. We hypothesized that short durations would be more active at different times in the diurnal cycle. Supplemental B was applied for 2 h at four different times. A night-break with B produced the highest yield and anthocyanin content. Our research demonstrates new ways to efficiently use readily available LEDs within the PAR wavebands to increase both yield and crop quality in controlled environment agriculture.

AB  - Vertical farming is becoming increasingly popular for production of leafy vegetables and herbs, with basil (Ocimum basilicum L.) as one of the most popular herbs. In basil most research has focused on increasing secondary metabolites with light spectra. However, knowledge about the effect of light intensity (photosynthetic photon flux density, PPFD) and spectra on growth and morphology is key for optimizing quality at harvest. The impact of PPFD and spectrum on plant growth and development is species dependent and currently few studies in basil are available. Understanding the response to End-Of-Production (EOP) light of growth and morphology is important for successful vertical farming. We performed a comprehensive series of experiments, where the effects of EOP PPFD, fraction of blue and their interaction on the growth and morphology were analyzed in two green and one purple basil cultivar. In addition, the impact of different EOP intensities and duration of far-red were investigated. We found that increasing the PPFD increased fresh mass, dry matter content and plant height in all three cultivars. The responses were linear or quadratic depending on the cultivar. A high fraction of blue (>90%) increased plant height and decreased the dry mass partitioning to the leaves. The only interaction found between the fraction of blue and overall PPFD was on plant height in the green cultivar whereas other growth parameters and morphology responded stronger to PPFD than to the fraction of blue light. Plant dry matter production was increased with the addition of far-red. Far-red EOP intensity treatments enhanced the fraction of dry mass partitioned to the leaves, whereas a prolonged far-red treatment enhanced partitioning to the stem. Both plant fresh mass and dry matter content were improved by applying high PPFD shortly before harvest. Light spectra were found to be of less importance than PPFD with respect to plant dry matter content. Light use efficiency (LUE) based on fresh mass decreased with increasing PPFD whereas LUE based on dry mass increased with increasing PPFD, when given as EOP treatments. The overall physiological mechanisms of the light intensity and spectral effects are discussed.

AB  - Irrigation scheduling and programming are very effective tools for efficient water use in a plant factory with artificial lighting (PFAL). In order to confirm optimal irrigation schemes for the production of cucumber scions and rootstocks in a PFAL, in this study, four different start points of irrigation were applied by measuring the weight of the plug tray to compare the growth of cucumber scions and rootstocks cultivated in a PFAL. Additionally, the growth characteristics of cucumber seedlings grafted with scions and rootstocks cultivated between in a greenhouse and in a PFAL were investigated. Although the growth of cucumber scions and rootstocks was highest when irrigation was conducted at 70% of water content in a medium, the growth of grafted cucumber seedlings before and after transplanting was not significantly different among the irrigation treatments in a PFAL. However, water use efficiency (WUE) during cucumber scions and rootstock production in a PFAL was higher at 60% than at 70%. Considering seedling growth and the efficiency of irrigation such as WUE and irrigation schedule, the optimal start point of irrigation during the production of cucumber scions and rootstocks in a PFAL was determined as 60% of water content in a medium. When the optimal irrigation regime was applied to the production of cucumber scions and rootstocks in a PFAL, the morphological characteristics of cucumber scions and rootstocks cultivated in a PFAL were more suitable for grafting compared with that of the cucumber scions and rootstocks cultivated conventionally in a greenhouse. The favorable environmental conditions during the cultivation of cucumber scions and rootstocks in a PFAL also positively affected the flowering response of cucumber grafted seedlings after transplanting.

AB  - Measuring the bioelectric potential of plants is believed to be a suitable real time and noninvasive method of evaluating plant activities, including photosynthetic reactions. When plants are illuminated, the amplitude of their bioelectric potential response correlates to their photosynthetic rate. However, in practice, the variation of the illuminating colors, the bioelectric potential responses, and the photosynthetic rates relate nonlinearly. This makes the photosynthesis evaluation very difficult. This study analyzes the nonlinear relationship using a neural network to improve the accuracy of evaluation. The analysis result shows that the correlation coefficient between the measured and estimated photosynthetic rates provided by the neural network is 0.95. This result is superior to those provided by multiple linear regression analysis. In addition, we demonstrate that the information on the plant bioelectric potential is necessary to estimate the accurate photosynthetic rate.

AB  - Vertical farming is a novel type of farming for fresh food production in the urban environment. Vertical farms are located in indoor environments with artificial solar radiation, completely insulated and protected from outdoor environmental conditions. Since cultivated plant species need many hours of light daily to meet their growth requirements, energy costs are very high, which can be an inhibiting factor for the advancement of the technology. In this research study, we tested the growth rate of basil plants (Genovese species) under two lighting systems. At first, the plants were grown under 16 h of continuous light, and in the second lighting system, under a photoperiod of 14 h with intermittent light. The light intensity was stable in both treatments. The purpose was to determine if intermittent light exposure could reduce the energy consumption of basil grown in indoor environments sufficiently and efficiently without adversely affecting the growth rate and biomass production of the plants. The results of the study showed that the intermittent lighting system, in which light was emitted intermittently in short (10-min) light cycles, did not affect negatively the quality and quantity of basil plants. It was found that the short light intervals were not sufficient to attain the optimal photosynthetic efficiency of the cultivation, while the overall photosynthetic rate did not decrease significantly under the indoor conditions. Finally, the evaluation of the energy footprint under various light treatments can have a positive impact on the energetic, economic, business, and ecological phases of indoor food production.

AB  - Traditionally, the innovation literature has viewed product innovation as the key competitive driver for firms in the market. But as demands for sustainability increase and technology is advancing sustainability-oriented innovation across industries, there is an opportunity to reconsider the role of process innovations. This study follows the market development process of a start-up founded on the principle of sustainability-oriented innovation and explores how the process innovation itself is used to shape the external market. This paper considers the relationship between process innovations and external market development through a longitudinal case study of a vertical farm start-up in Stockholm, Sweden. Findings show that through a number of representational practices, process innovation can also serve external objectives and play a role in external market development for firms incorporating the principles of sustainability-oriented innovation.

AB  - In a plant factory, improper design of the indoor ventilation system may cause tip burn on lettuce plants due to the existence of stagnant air in the leaf boundary layer and low transpiration rates. In this study, three types of air ducts with different pore numbers and diameters were designed to generate a constant horizontal airflow on the surface of plant canopy. A three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was established to analyse the airflow pattern on the crop canopy under different ventilation modes in a single cultivation bed. For this simulation model, the lettuce leaves were treated as a porous medium, and the drag coefficient (C-D) was assumed to be 0.02, which resulted in a permeability (K-p) and nonlinear momentum loss coefficient (C-F) of 0.02 and 0.134, respectively. The LED lamps were set as the energy source, and the heat released was calculated to be 297.5 kW m(-3). All the data above were validated. Three Designs with different pore numbers and diameters were simulated to predict the distribution of airflow. The design with 12 pores and 15 mm diameter was predicted to give the highest percentage of mean air velocity between 0.28 m s(-1) and 1.04 m s(-1) on the lettuce canopy surface, at 70.3%. This duct design is recommended as the best of the three Designs in this study. (C) 2020 IAgrE. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The identification and control of light stress is the key to the high-yield and high-quality production of leafy vegetables in a controlled environment. As a widely grown vegetable in the plant factory, lettuce is responsive to light intensity. Strong or weak light will seriously affect its yield and quality. These differences can be articulated by images and then classified by fine-grained classification methods. Deep learning is commonly used in crop image classification due to its fast and convenient advantages, but conventional fine-grained recognition approaches are still extremely challenging in dealing with this kind of inter-species classification. To address this issue, this work takes lettuce as the research object and established a set of leaf images for lettuce light stress grading. The leaves were divided into four categories depending on the changes in shoot fresh weight. Then, a hierarchical fusion convolutional neural network architecture (MFC-CNN) based on multi-scale input was constructed to grade the light stress. We firstly separate leaf patches from complete leaf and construct four-scale input to expand local leaf vein and texture information. The multi-scale dataset is fed into the main network at different depths according to the characteristics of CNN in feature extraction. Finally, the network is tested through comparative experiments. The results show that the proposed model has obvious advantages in light stress dataset and generalized dataset.

KW  - FRAMEWORK
AB  - A plant factory is an environmentally controlled facility that can sustain stable crop cultivation while ensuring fast production and better crop quality by manipulating temperature, humidity, lighting, nutrient supply, and other cultivation factors. It requires better cultivation planning to fully utilise the facility since the set up and operating costs are high. This study aims to schedule crops in a commercial plant factory to maximise revenue by determining which crops are cultivated, the quantity, and at what time. The model considers not only crop market prices but also crop properties such as cultivation duration, volume change, multiple periods of harvests, and yield rates under different environmental settings. The problem is formulated as a mixed integer programming problem to find an optimal schedule. For a large size problem, Lagrangian relaxation with surrogate subgradient method is applied to obtain a good solution in a short time. The numerical results show that, compared to the integer program solver, the proposed method provides faster solutions with more than 80% efficacy when longer planning periods and multiple cultivation rooms are considered.

AB  - Although light-emitting diode (LED) lamps have been broadly applied in horticultural production to improve plant yield and quality, compared to natural light there is a disadvantage in the lack of far-red light in the LED spectrum. Far-red light has been studied widely to control plant growth and development. Therefore, this study aimed to find the effect of supplemental far-red-enriched LED lights to control the growth of tomato, red pepper, cucumber, gourd, watermelon and bottle gourd seedlings. The treatments were cool white LED:far-red LED at ratios of 5:0, 5:1, 5:2 and 5:3. The growth of tomato and red pepper seedlings, including hypocotyl length, was correlated to far-red light and light intensity. The phytochrome photostationary state (PSS) value of maximum hypocotyl length by supplemental far-red-enriched light ranged from 0.69 to 0.77 in tomato and red pepper seedlings. Although hypocotyl lengths of cucumber and watermelon were greatly affected by PSS, the PSS value for maximum hypocotyl length was lower than for tomato and red pepper. These results show that manipulating supplemental far-red enrichment can be used to control vegetable seedling growth with some variation among plant species.

AB  - This study investigated growth and ginsenosides content of ginseng sprouts under various light spectra. One-year-old ginseng seedlings were cultivated under various light treatments including: monochromatic (red (R), green (G), and blue (B)), various RB and RGB combinations, white (fluorescent lamps (FL) and natural white (NW)), and supplemental far red (FR). R and high R ratio increased growth characteristics of ginseng sprouts (excepted for root dry weight). The replacement of G for B in RGB group and W group did not increase the growth, and supplemental FR increased shoot and root fresh weights, total fresh weight, and leaf area. R had 1.5 times higher photosynthetic rate compared to B and G, and R(8)G(1)B(1) and R(9)G(1)B(0) showed the highest values in RGB group; whereas the RB, W, and FR groups did not enhance photosynthetic rate. B and high B ratio increased shoot saponin and ginsenosides, total saponin and ginsenosides contents. Total saponin content in shoot was 4.4 times higher than that in root. The supplemental FR enhanced both total saponin and ginsenosides contents. In conclusion, NW + FR showed the highest total fresh weight, saponin and ginsenosides contents among all treatments, suggesting that supplementation of FR has a positive effect on ginseng sprouts grown in plant factories.

   The presented analysis allows to estimate the sense of using exhaust air as a source of water recovery for the purposes of watering plants in the cultivated halls potentially located in Wroclaw (Poland, Lower Silesia).
   This paper presents the characteristics of the operation of the system for recovery of water from exhaust air in moderate climates in the years 2012-2019. The proposed system for water recovery uses the phenomenon of condensation in a cross-flow heat exchanger operating as an element of the air conditioning system. The parameters of exhaust air behind the heat exchanger have been determined using a mathematical model of the so-called black box. The mathematical model considers the risk of the cross-freezing of the heat exchanger. The calculations carried out for variable parameters of external air during the analyzed period confirm that the system allows to cover the demand for water for lettuce irrigation during the cold and transitional period, which is a major part of the year. It has been noted that the effectiveness of the system is very high (av. 67.12% per year) due to the specific parameters of the internal air in which the lettuce must be grown and the need for continuous air exchange in such facilities. This means that air is a stable source of water recovery, where the recovery rate depends on the parameters of external air.

AB  - To verify the productivity of the autotrophic transplant production method (ATPM), a novel propagation method in a plant factory with artificial lighting for transplant production (T-PFAL), strawberry transplants were produced by the ATPM for 365 days. A total of 3497 transplants were produced by the ATPM over 365 days with nine propagules in a cultivation area of 3.6 m(2) in the T-PFAL. When the simulated results were fit with the measured results, the propagation cycle timescales from planting propagules to producing the first, second, and third runner plants were 15, 27, and 43 days, respectively. The cumulative number of transplants (CNT) produced from 5, 10, and 20 initial propagules in a cultivation area of 36 m(2) over 365 days was simulated by the verified program along with the propagation cycles, and these values were 27,970, 30,010, and 31,900, respectively. The simulated CNTs from nine initial propagules in 18 and 72 m(2) over 365 days were 15,950 and 55,940, respectively. These results indicate that the ATPM is an appropriate propagation method to produce transplants rapidly in a T-PFAL, especially when the number of propagules or propagules is limited.

AB  - This research examined the effects of the supplementary or night-interrupting (NI) blue (B) light supplied at a low intensity on the flowering, gene expression, and morphogenesis of chrysanthemum, a qualitative short-day plant. White (W) light-emitting diodes (LEDs) were used to provide light with a photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) of 180 mu mol center dot m(-2)center dot s(-1) during the photoperiod to grow the plants in a plant factory. The control group was constructed with plants that were exposed to a 10-h short day (SD10) treatment without any blue light. The B light in this research was used for 4 h to either (1) extend the photoperiod for plants at the end of a 9-h short day (SD) treatment as the sole light source (SD9 + 4B), (2) provide night interruption (NI) to plants in the 13-h long-day (LD) treatment (LD13 + NI - 4B), (3) provide NI to plants in the 10-h SD treatment (SD10 + NI - 4B), or (4) supplement the W LEDs at the end of a 13-h LD treatment (LD13 + 4B). Blue LEDs were used to provide the supplementary/NI light at 10 mu mol center dot m(-2)center dot s(-1) PPFD. The LD13 + NI - 4B treatment resulted in the greatest plant height, followed by LD13 + 4B. Plants in all treatments flowered. It is noteworthy that despite the fact that chrysanthemum is a qualitative SD plant, chrysanthemum plants flowered when grown in the LD13 + 4B and LD13 + NI - 4B treatments. Plants grown in the LD13 + 4B had the greatest number of flowers. Plants grown in the LD13 + 4B treatment had the highest expression levels of the cryptochrome 1, phytochrome A, and phytochrome B genes. The results of this study indicate that a 4-h supplementation of B light during the photoperiod increases flower bud formation and promotes flowering, and presents a possibility as an alternative method to using blackout curtains in LD seasons to practically induce flowering. The B light application methods to induce flowering in SD plants requires further research.

AB  - The horticulture sector in the Netherlands is a global leader due to technological advancements, knowledge of greenhouse cultivation with high productivities and low resource usage, and entrepreneurship. The Netherlands is the second largest exporter of vegetables in the world, and more than half of its land area is used for agriculture with some greenhouse complexes covering 175 acres. However, to retain this leading position, the sector has acknowledged that it needs to keep innovating. To further reduce waste and environmental impact, an innovative production strategy is being developed to support a circular economy: the circular greenhouse. LDE Greenport Hub is an entity of the strategic alliance of the universities of Leiden, Delft and Erasmus and is focused on horticulture scientific research and education in collaboration with major horticulture industry partners (such as sector association Glastuinbouw Nederland). It has initiated 'Mission to Mars', a program to boost innovation and development of the circular greenhouse by adopting concepts and technologies from space. Space is inherently focused on circularity because of scarce resources. A good example is the MELiSSA concept of the European Space Agency in which human waste is broken down into nutrients for crops and algae by a series of bioreactors. The crops and algae consequently provide food and oxygen for the crew again. The Mission to Mars program started with a lecture series in the beginning of 2018 at the World Horti Center, a horticulture business and innovation center in Naaldwijk. In seven lectures different aspects of sustainability and circularity were explored together with researchers, students, growers and horticulturists. The lectures covered (1) energy, (2) water, (3) lighting and climate, (4) soil, substrate and plant health, (5) material and energy streams, (6) digitization and automation, and (7) urban and vertical farming. It quickly became clear that not only terrestrial horticulture could benefit from space technologies, but that human space exploration could equally benefit from the technical and tacit knowledge of growers and horticulturists for food production in space. A list of potential research topics was identified. These topics are to be explored in a follow-up ESA Innovation Exchange, together with space technology partner ICE Cubes. The goal is to go beyond the circular greenhouse and demonstrate how space itself can be an environment for plant biology innovation, and hence increase future food security on Earth.

AB  - Background: Agricultural production in controlled indoor farming offers a reliable alternative to food and nutrition supply for densely populated cities and contributes to addressing the impending food insecurity. Leafy vegetables, rich in vitamins, minerals, fibres and antioxidants, account for over half of the indoor farming operations worldwide. Light is the foremost environmental factor for plant growth and development, and the success of indoor farming largely depends on lighting qualities. The energy efficient light-emitting diode (LED) has been increasingly used in indoor farming systems.
   Scope and approach: Here we provide an updated overview of the current indoor vertical farming systems, the mechanisms of light perception by photoreceptors, and the effects of LED spectra or intensity on growth and phytonutrient accumulation of leafy greens. We also outline the challenges in interpreting and applying the research findings in the field and highlight issues to be addressed.
   Key findings and conclusions: Lighting quality and quantity can be manipulated to improve yield and phytonutrient contents of leafy greens. As responses of leafy greens to light are dependent on genotype and developmental stage, light recipe targeting different developmental stages should be formulated for different species for maximizing yield. While it has been known that blue wavelength has a more prominent positive impact on phytonutrient accumulation than red, little is known for other wavelengths. Moreover, recent findings that green wavelength inhibits plant growth in a blue-wavelength-dependent manner highlight the need for future research to investigate interactive effects of different wavelengths on modulating plant growth and metabolism.

AB  - Light conditions are crucial for vegetable quality in terms of sensory properties and nutritional composition. Well planned lighting systems enable effective production and extend production season, even for year around production. Further factors, like climate change, growing urban population (urban plant factories), seasonal employment, developing consumer expectations in security, safety, freshness, and price-quality ratio of vegetables and fruits reinforce the expansion of LED systems. The main obstacle of shifting to LED lighting in plant production is that involves a complex system change beyond lighting (e.g. plant recipes, which are species- and in several cases cultivar-dependent), resulting serious associated costs. Also, lack of quality standards for solid state lighting in horticulture has been frequently mentioned. Therefore, light source measurement, parameters, metrics, and labeling was reviewed. Presented increasing number of scientific publications, patents and the increasing role of LEDs in R + D, and innovation related projects indicate that the technological background is developing fast.

AB  - In recent years, urban agriculture (UA) projects have bloomed throughout the world, finding large applications also in the developed economies of the so-called Global North. As compared to projects in developing countries, where research has mainly targeted the contribution to food security, UA in the Global North has a stronger multifunctional connotation, and results in multiple combinations of farming purposes and business models pursued. The present review paper explores the contribution and role that UA plays in cities from the Global North, defining its functionalities toward ecosystem services (ES) provisioning and analyzing the factors that hinders and promote its regional diffusion and uptake. The manuscript integrates a description of UA growing systems, as well opportunities for crop diversification in the urban environment, and a comprehensive classification of UA business models. The distinctive features in terms of business models, farming purposes and farm size are then applied over an inventory of 470 UA projects in the Global North, allowing for a characterization and comparative analysis of distribution frequency of the different project typologies.

AB  - Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have been widely used in plant factories and agricultural facilities. Different LEDs can be designed in accordance with the light quality and intensity requirements of different plants, allowing the regulation of plant growth and development, as well as metabolic processes. Blue and red lights have significant effects on anthocyanin metabolism in strawberry fruit, but their effects on other metabolites are unknown. Here, we studied the effects of blue and red lights on the metabolism and gene expression of strawberry using metabolomics combined with transcriptomics. A total of 33 differentially expressed metabolites (DEMs) and 501 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were isolated and identified. Among these DEMs, chlorogenic acid synthesis was upregulated by the blue light compared with the red light. Co-expression network analysis of DEMs and DEGs revealed that the expression of hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA:shikimate hydroxycinnamoyltransferase (FvHCT), the main gene in the chlorogenic acid synthetic pathway, was induced by blue light. Using multi-omics-based approach, our results suggest that different LED lights have multiple effects on strawberry fruit, with blue light able to co-upregulate chlorogenic acid synthesis and FvHCT gene expression.

AB  - Spinach is a leafy vegetable containing a plethora of bioactive compounds. Our study aimed to evaluate the physiological (i.e., JIP-test) and phytochemical response of spinach baby leaves grown with regular or mildly saline (40 mM NaCl) nutrient solution and irradiated by four light-emitting diodes (LEDs) with broad spectra. T1 (highest red and far-red, low blue) and T3 (high red, balanced blue, green and far-red) led to a better developed photosynthetic apparatus compared to T2 (red peak in 631 nm) and T4 (highest blue and green), highlighted by PIABS and its structural components: RC/ABS, phi(P0), psi(E0), and Delta V-IP. Elevated salinity only affected the latter parameter. T1 induced the maximum yield production but also the highest nitrate content which was far below the maximum level permitted by European legislation. Regardless of salinity level, T3 enhanced total phenol, chlorophyll, and carotenoid content. T2 and T4 led to inferior nutritional quality. Non-saline nutrient solution promoted the chlorophyll and carotenoid contents and the antioxidant potential, regardless of light treatment. By contrast, soluble sugar content was enhanced by saline nutrient solution. Our study shows that physiology and nutritional quality of spinach baby leaves can be manipulated by small interplays in the light spectra and salinity level.

AB  - Plant phenotyping plays a crucial role in understanding variations in the phenotype of individual plants affected by environment, management, and genotype. Measurement of seed germination is an important phenotyping stage as germination impacts on the whole plant growth process. However, germination measurement has been limited to germination percentage of a seed population. Understanding of the germination time, from sowing to outbreak of the radicle from seed coat, at a single seed level is essential. How individual germination time and further plant growth are affected by its microenvironment and management factors remains elusive. Plant phenotype measurement system was developed to assess individual germination time of romaine lettuce (Lactuca sativa L. var. longifolia), using time-series two-dimensional camera images, and to analyze how microenvironment (volumetric water percent in seed tray, individual seed surface temperature and air temperature) and management factors (coated/uncoated seeds) affect the germination time for plant cohort research, emphasizing practicality in commercial cultivation. Germination experiments were conducted to demonstrate the performance of the system and its applicability for a whole plant growth process in a plant factory for commercial production and/or breeding. The developed phenotyping platform revealed the effects of microenvironment and management factors on germination time of individual seeds.

AB  - LED red (R) and blue (B) continuous light (CL) is a potential efficient way to increase plant productivity of plant factory with artificial light (PFAL), but limited information was explored about their effects on plant mineral nutrition. In an environmentally controlled plant factory with artificial light (PFAL), the effects of CL of different intensities and spectral qualities, emitted by R and B LEDs on growth and nutrient element content and accumulation of lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.), were conducted in three hydroponic experiments. Two treatments, normal light (12 h/12 h) and CL (24 h/0 h) in experiment 1, three CL intensities (100, 200 and 300 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1)) in experiment 2, and three CL light qualities (1R:3B, 1R:1B and 3R:1B) in experiment 3 were designed. The results showed that CL significantly increased the fresh and dry lettuce shoot biomass compared with normal light, and shoot fresh and dry biomass increased with the intensity increment of CL. In experiment 3, shoot fresh biomass was great under high R light proportion CL treatment, while dry shoot biomass remained unchanged. Both CL and CL with increased intensities promoted shoot C content and accumulation in lettuce. CL reduced N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Cu and Zn contents in lettuce shoot, while Fe and Mn contents did not change compared to NL. Moreover, CL increased Ca, Fe and Mn accumulation. 100-200 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1) CL facilitated N, P, Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn, Cu and Zn contents in shoot, but K content was not influenced compared with 300 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1). The data showed that high B light ratio (75%) facilitated C content comparison with low B ratios (50% and 25%). However, lettuce grown under 3R1B treatment had the higher C accumulation. Shoot N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn and Zn contents were higher under 1R1B treatment, and Cu content did not affected by light quality. Moreover, accumulation of N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn, Zn and Cu in shoot was higher under 1R1B treatment, while P, Ca, Mg, Mn accumulation under 3R1B treatment was the lowest. In conclusion, CL tends to reduce shoot mineral element contents due to dilution effect as shoot dry weight increases compared to NL. However, long-term (12 days) CL composed of 1R1B, 100-200 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1) tends to obtain relative higher K, Ca, Fe and Zn contents in the greater dry lettuce shoot.

AB  - Monitoring equipment for plant-factory automation requires big capital investments. Low-cost open-source microcontroller platforms have been employed in agriculture to monitor and control different variables of importance for crop production. A low-cost plant-factory monitoring system for measuring air temperature, relative humidity, plant-leaf temperature, pH, electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen and temperature of the nutrient solution is presented here. All the information is recorded in a micro SD memory and can be accessed by Bluetooth in real-time. The developed system was tested during a cycle of a lettuce crop in a research plant-factory facility. The quality of the collected data was evaluated and compared with a well-known research-grade monitoring system. The low-cost sensors showed an easy to correct bias when were compared to those of research-grade, with a correlation coefficient over 0.96. The results showed that low-cost systems, like the one implemented here, are a good alternative for monitoring environmental and physiological variables in controlled environmental agriculture facilities.

AB  - The photoperiod is a day-length-dependent seasonal change of physiological or developmental activities, such as flowering, in many plant species. Polygonum tinctorium (P. tinctorium) is an important industrial crop producing indigo blue dyes, and indican is an important substance as a precursor of indigo. Here, we report the day-length dependent responses of growth, flowering, and indican synthesis in P. tinctorium. Indigo plants were grown in a hydroponic system under artificial light conditions in a completely-controlled plant factory. The growth parameters and indican content of leaves were measured and compared. Certain growth parameters (such as fresh weight and number of leaves) under 24-h continuous irradiation were significantly higher than those under other day-length conditions. Under 12-h photoperiod conditions, the flowering rate of plants with blue LED treatment increased six-fold compared with fluorescent white light treatment, while none of the plants flowered with red LED treatment. In the leaves, the relative expression levels of Pt'IGS and Pt'BGL were significantly higher in newer leaves compared to older ones. Indican content was greatly enhanced by blue light under 24-h continuous irradiation, which was reflected by increased expression levels of Pt'IGS. These findings demonstrate that there is a new regulatory mechanism for the indican synthesis pathway through blue light signalling. Blue light provides feasible strategy for artificially regulating indican synthesis and flowering in P. tinctorium.

AB  - Light recommendations for horticultural crops often focus on the optimal daily light integral (DLI) without regard to how that light is delivered throughout each day. Because photosynthesis is more efficient at lower photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD), we hypothesized that longer photoperiods with lower PPFD results in faster growth than shorter photoperiods with higher PPFD and the same DLI. We quantified the effect of different photoperiods, all providing the same DLI, on photosynthesis and growth of two leafy greens. Mizuna (Brassica rapa var. japonica) and lettuce (Lactuca sativa) "Little Gem" were grown from seed in a controlled environment chamber (20 degrees C and 819 mu mol center dot mol(-1) CO2) under six photoperiods (10, 12, 14, 16, 18, and 20 h). LED fixtures provided white light and PPFD was adjusted so each treatment received a DLI of 16 mol center dot m(-2)center dot d(-1). Mizuna and lettuce were harvested 30 and 41 days after planting, respectively. Longer photoperiods with lower PPFD increased light interception, chlorophyll content index, quantum yield of photosystem II, and aboveground biomass, but decreased instantaneous CO2 assimilation of lettuce and mizuna. Aboveground biomass increased 16.0% in lettuce and 18.7% in mizuna in response to increasing the photoperiod from 10 to 20 h. In summary, extending the photoperiod and lowering PPFD increases growth of lettuce and mizuna by increasing light interception and the quantum yield of photosystem II.

AB  - In this paper we examine the potential of digital platforms for managing multidisciplinary collaboration and particularly the ideation processes of multidisciplinary research and development in the case of technology-supported vertical farming. The article draws on research data from semi-structured interviews and a collaborative workshop that was conducted with researchers representing biological, digital, and technological domains. The results of this research indicate that digital platforms may offer impactful, process-accelerating support during the kick-off phase of multidisciplinary technological innovations. A digital platform can support ideation and the prioritisation of ideas and can be especially fruitful when paired with face to face discussion and non-digital interaction.

AB  - Good lighting designs can establish suitable light environments in plant factories with artificial light (PFALs). This study used optical simulations to investigate the effects of lighting designs in PFALs on the coefficient of variation of light absorption (phi(p; CV)) of individual plants and the coefficient of utilization for the lighting system (U). Three-dimensional models of canola plants were constructed using a scanner, and a 3D model of the cultivation shelf was also created. The photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) distribution in the cultivation spaces, with or without the canola plants, was estimated first. The PPFD on the canola leaves was then estimated when the lighting design parameters, such as number, distance, height, radiant flux, and light distribution of the light-emitting diode lamps, were modified. The optical simulation showed good accuracy when estimating the PPFD distributions on the cultivation shelf and the leaves of the canola plants. The results showed that while the PPFD distribution across the growing area was uniform, it was not on a plant canopy. By appropriately controlling the layout of the lamps and their directionality, lighting designs that reduce phi(p; CV) and improve U in PFAL could be possible, and optical simulations could help to develop them.

AB  - Indoor vertical farming offers great opportunities regarding a sustainable and consistent production of high-quality herbs and raw materials all year round for the perfume, chemical, or food industry. Cultivation takes place in an enclosed structure, operating predominantly independent from external conditions in multi-layer systems equipped with artificial lighting, enabling extremely high resource use efficiencies with a simultaneous increase in yield. On the other hand, field production in terms of plant quality and harvesting times is highly influenced by environmental conditions, making it difficult to maintain homogenous raw material qualities throughout the year. To show how different light qualities affect the overall efficiency and quality of Origanum majorana grown in an indoor farm, the resource consumption, yield, and cultivation time as well as the essential oil quantity was analyzed, and the efficiencies in terms of energy and land use efficiency calculated. The experimental setup clearly demonstrated that the yield regarding fresh as well as dry matter and oil content was comparable to one square meter of open field production. Based on this, the multi-layer system and the noticeable lowered growth period result in a significantly higher area efficiency compared to the open field, leading to a potential increase of annual yields of dried leave weight and oil contents by up to 21 times. It was also shown that a white spectrum (W) showed similar influence on plant growth and yield as a spectrum consisting of blue and red (B/R). Nevertheless, the LED treatment W did show higher light use efficiencies as well as a better working conditions inside the cultivation chamber. By an integration of indoor vertical farming into existing industrial processes, new and innovative opportunities for a flexible and low-risk supply chain seem feasible and according to German food industry meet the interests of existing stakeholders.

AB  - Light is a crucial environmental signal and photosynthetic energy for plant growth, development, and primary and secondary metabolism. To explore the effects of light quality on the growth and root exudates of hydroponic lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.), white LED (W, control) and four the mixtures of red (R) and blue (B) LED with different R/B light intensity ratios (R/B = 2, 2R1B; R/B = 3, 3R1B; R/B = 4, 4R1B; and R/B = 8, 8R1B) were designed. The results showed that the biomass of lettuce under 8R1B and W treatments was higher than that under other light quality treatments. The photosynthetic rate (Pn) under red and blue light was significantly higher than that of white light. Total root length, root surface area, and root volume were the highest under 8R1B. 4R1B treatment significant increased root activity by 68.6% compared with W. In addition, total organic carbon (TOC) content, TOC content/shoot dry weight, TOC content/root dry weight, and TOC content/root surface area were the highest under 4R1B. Moreover, 8R1B treatment reduced the concentration of benzoic acid and salicylic acid, and the secretion ability of benzoic acid and salicylic acid by per unit root surface area and accumulation by per unit shoot dry weight. In addition, 2R1B and 3R1B reduced the secretion ability of gallic acid and tannic acid by per unit root surface area and accumulation by per unit shoot dry weight. In conclusion, this study showed that the secretion of autotoxins could be reduced through the mediation of red and blue light composition of LEDs in a plant factory. In terms of autotoxin secretion reduction efficiency and yield performance of lettuce, 8R1B light regime is recommended for practical use.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of constant light and alternating relatively high-intensity (500 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) and low-intensity (150 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) red-blue LEDs (4R:1B) on the biomass production and quality of hydroponic purple-leaf lettuce (Lactuca sativa L. cv. 'Zishan') in an environmentally controlled plant factory. Four treatments were set up to separate 1 h of high light into four different alternating frequencies in a 24-h light-dark cycle (16/8 h): one time (A1), three times (A3), six times (A6), and twelve times (A12). In addition, one constant light treatment with the same daily light integral (DLI, 9.8 mol m(-2) per day) as other treatments was set as the control (CK, 170 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)). The results indicated that A6 significantly reduced shoot fresh weight and increased the root-shoot ratio of lettuce compared with CK, but there was no significant difference among other treatments. Alternating light treatments did not promote the accumulation of soluble sugar, soluble protein, and phenolic substances compared with CK. Meanwhile, A12 significantly promoted the accumulation of total ascorbate (TA) in lettuce leaves compared with other treatments but decreased ascorbate/TA ratio. Above all, under the same DLI condition, alternating high and low light did not have obvious positive effects on biomass production and the accumulation of nutrient substance in lettuce under constant light was better than that under alternating light. Therefore, compared with the fluctuating radiation with the same DLI, constant radiation is a better choice for lettuce production.

AB  - The application of plant factory with artificial lighting (PFAL) for producing strawberry transplants (S-PFAL) was recently introduced due to the capacity for high quality and year-round transplant production. To achieve greater efficiency with this system, it is essential to select lighting sources that have a suitable spectrum for runner plant propagation. This study was conducted to investigate the effects of the light spectrum of white light-emitting diodes (LEDs), which have a different correlated color temperature compared with that of white fluorescent lamps, on the growth of strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa Duch. cv. Maehyang) propagules and runner plants in a PFAL. Uniform propagules with one fixed runner each were placed into a PFAL for transplant production and were grown under either warm-white LEDs (WWL), mint-white LEDs (MWL), or cool-white fluorescent lamps (CWF) for 21 days. The propagules in the MWL treatment group had the greatest number of leaves, leaf area, top/root dry weight ratio and number of newly formed runners per propagule among the treatments. The dry weight of the newly formed runners of each propagule was also greatest after MWL treatment, whereas it was lowest after CWF treatment. However, there was no significant difference in the growth parameters of the runner plants among the three treatments. The photosynthetic photon efficacy of WWL and MWL was 5.40 mu mol s(- 1) W- 1, which was 62.6% higher than that of CWF (3.38 mu mol s(- 1) W- 1). The dry weight efficacies of the MWL, WWL, and CWF treatments were 23.5, 22.1, and 10.0 g kWh(- 1), respectively. These results indicate that MWL with high photosynthetic photon efficacy can have positive effects on the runner formation and growth of strawberry propagules and can replace cool-white fluorescent lamps in an S-PFAL.

AB  - Aralia elata is a famous homology of traditional medicine and wild vegetable due to its enriched content of flavonoids and saponins. Heavy exploration for shoots has nearly resulted in the exhaustion of the natural reserve of this species, but its traditional culture regime largely depends on land use in the long term. In this study, 1-year-old A. elata seedlings were cultured in commercial substrate under a plant factory condition where lighting was supplied by light-emitting diode (LED) panels in two bionic spectra of 16.9% red (R), 77.8% green (G), and 5.4% blue (B) (R2G4B2) and 12.5% R, 84.6% G, and 2.9% B (R2G10B1) to mimic the understory sunlight in natural populations. An artificial spectrum of 26.6% R, 59.9% G, and 13.5% B (R2G1B3) was also involved as the comparison. All LED lighting had a daily photoperiod of 18 h at the photosynthetic photon flux rate of 150 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). Seedlings were fed by exponential fertilization at the rate of 140 mg nitrogen (N) plant(-1)[N-phosphorus (P)(2)O-5-potassium (K)(2)O, 9-30-20]. Shoots were harvested twice with a midway cutting. The R2G10B1 spectrum promoted concentrations of N, P, starch, and total saponins in the secondly harvested shoots, where the R2G4B2 spectrum enhanced stem length, fresh weight, N content, and total saponin content per sprouted shoot. Total flavonoid content had a positive correlation with weight and contents of N, P and sugars, but the positive correlation of total saponins was only with weight. The drastic decline of sprout density in the second harvest decreased the content of total saponins in grouped A. elata seedlings. We conclude that light spectra and shoot cutting had a combined effect on biomass accumulation and total saponins which can be promoted in shoot-cut A. elata seedlings in the R2G4B2 spectrum under plant factory condition.

AB  - Indoor plant cultivation systems are gaining increasing popularity because of their ability to meet the needs of producing food in unfavourable climatic contexts and in urban environments, allowing high yield, high quality, and great efficiency in the use of resources such as water and nutrients. While light is one of the most important environmental factors affecting plant development and morphology, electricity costs can limit the widespread adoption of indoor plant cultivation systems at a commercial scale. LED lighting technologies for plant cultivation are also rapidly evolving, and lamps for indoor cultivation are often designed to optimize their light emissions in the photosynthetically active spectrum (i.e. red and blue), in order to reduce energetic requirements for satisfactory yield. Under these light regimens, however, little information is available in literature about minimum photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) for indoor production of leafy vegetables and herbs, while existing literature often adopts light intensities from 100 to 300 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). This study aims at defining the optimal PPFD for indoor cultivation of basil (Ocimum basilicum L.) and lettuce (Lactuca saliva L.), by linking resource use efficiency to physiological responses and biomass production under different light intensities. Basil and lettuce plants were cultivated at 24 degrees C and 450 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) CO2 under red and blue light (with red:blue ratio of 3) and a photoperiod of 16 h d(-1) of light in growth chambers using five PPFD (100, 150, 200, 250 and 300 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), resulting in daily light integrals, DLI, of 5.8, 8.6, 11.5, 14.4 and 17.3 mol m(-2) d(-1), respectively). A progressive increase of biomass production for both lettuce and basil up to a PPFD of 250 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) was observed, whereas no further yield increases were associated with higher PPFD (300 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)). Despite the highest stomatal conductance associated to a PPFD of 250 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) in lettuce and to a PPFD >= 200 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) in basil, water use efficiency was maximized under a PPFD >= 200 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) in lettuce and PPFD >= 250 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) in basil. Energy and light use efficiencies were increased under a PPFD of 200 and 250 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) in lettuce and under a PPFD of 250 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) in basil. Furthermore, in lettuce grown under 250 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) antioxidant capacity, phenolics and flavonoids were higher as compared with plants supplied with PPFD <= 150 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). Accordingly, a PPFD of 250 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) seems suitable for optimizing yield and resource use efficiency in red and blue LED lighting for indoor cultivation of lettuce and basil under the prevailing conditions of the used indoor farming set-up.

AB  - The light spectrum has a strong effect on potato tuber development. To investigate the effect of varying the spectrum on potato tuber growth and yield, potato plantlets were transplanted under red/white light (RW; red light: 200 mu mol m(-2) s(-1); white light: 100 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)), blue/white light (BW; blue light: 200 mu mol m(-2) s(-1); white light: 100 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)), and white/red/blue light (WRB; white light: 100 mu mol m(-2) s(-1); red light: 100 mu mol m(-2) s(-1); blue light: 100 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) with a 11/13-h (light/dark) photoperiod. Potato plants grown under RW had the highest mean fresh tuber weight and total yield among all treatments. Plants under RW resulted in the highest shoot dry weight at 30 d and 45 d among all treatments, providing a photosynthetic source for the tubers. Furthermore, the photosynthetic leaves under RW had a significantly higher total chlorophyll content than other treatments at 90 d. Plants under RW significantly increased tuber fresh weight per plant by 57.7% from 60 to 90 d. The spectrum of BW benefited potato bulking. Plants under BW at 40 d resulted in significant sucrose and starch changes between day and night compared with those at 20 d. BW had a positive effect on the activities of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase at 40 d and sucrose synthase at 60 d compared with RW and WRB during the day. Thus, the ratio of tuber (fresh weight of tuber >= 2.0 g) under BW was significantly higher than that under RW and WRB. The total yield of tubers under WRB was the lowest among all treatments.

AB  - There is scarce public knowledge regarding comparable feasible business formats. This paper develops a Vertical Farm Business Framework to raise our understanding of the major, generic items in the development of Vertical Farms as commercial endeavours. The huge variety of the research objects and the early stage of research into business formats makes exploratory research the suited approach. A review of the related literature is complemented by a validation by 25 insiders from Europe and North America. When it comes to governance and cooperation good partnerships are deemed fitting, especially with distribution centres and specific food sectors. Regarding organization, there is optimism on drastic costs decreases due to advances in lighting, HVAC, and automation. Finally, as part of the enabling environment, the social value of Vertical Farms is not clear, and legal issues were not found to be a major concern, apart from zoning issues. A prominent theme became the need for properly trained employees. In sum, establishing a commercially viable Vertical Farm remains a complex matter, where strategic decision can benefit from a Vertical Farm Business Framework.

AB  - In the near future, the fifth-generation wireless technology is expected to be rolled out, offering low latency, high bandwidth and multiple antennas deployed in a single access point. This ecosystem will help further enhance various location-based scenarios such as assets tracking in smart factories, precise smart management of hydroponic indoor vertical farms and indoor way-finding in smart hospitals. Such a system will also integrate existing technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT), WiFi and other network infrastructures. In this respect, 5G precise indoor localization using heterogeneous IoT technologies (Zigbee, Raspberry Pi, Arduino, BLE, etc.) is a challenging research area. In this work, an experimental 5G testbed has been designed integrating C-RAN and IoT networks. This testbed is used to improve both vertical and horizontal localization (3D Localization) in a 5G IoT environment. To achieve this, we propose the DEep Learning-based co-operaTive Architecture (DELTA) machine learning model implemented on a 3D multi-layered fingerprint radiomap. The DELTA begins by estimating the 2D location. Then, the output is recursively used to predict the 3D location of a mobile station. This approach is going to benefit use cases such as 3D indoor navigation in multi-floor smart factories or in large complex buildings. Finally, we have observed that the proposed model has outperformed traditional algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN).

AB  - Southern highbush blueberry cultivation has expanded into non-traditional growing areas worldwide due to elite cultivars and improved horticultural practices. This article presents a comprehensive review of current production systems-alternatives to traditional open field production-such as production in protected environments, high-density plantings, evergreen production, and container-based production. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each system and compare their differences to open field production. In addition, we provide potential solutions for some of the disadvantages. We also highlight some of the gaps existing between academic studies and production in industry, providing a guide for future academic research. All these alternative systems have shown the potential to produce high yields with high-quality berries. Alternative systems, compared to field production, require higher establishment investments and thus create an entry barrier for new producers. Nevertheless, with their advantages, alternative productions have the potential to be profitable.

AB  - The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report that to limit warming to 1.5 degrees C, Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) is required. Integrated assessment models (IAMS) predict that a land area between the size of Argentina and Australia is required for bioenergy crops, a 3-7 time increase in the current bioenergy planting area globally. The authors pose the question of whether vertical farming (VF) technology can enable BECCS deployment, either via land sparing or supply. VF involves indoor controlled environment cultivation, and can increase productivity per unit land area by 5-10 times. VF is predominantly being used to grow small, high value leafy greens with rapid growth cycles. Capital expenditure, operational expenditure, and sustainability are challenges in current VF industries, and will affect the ability to utilise this technology for other crops. The authors argue that, whilst challenging, VF could help reach wider climate goals. Application of VF for bioenergy crops could be a game changer in delivering BECCS technologies and may reduce the land footprint required as well as the subsequent associated negative environmental impacts. VF bioenergy could allow us to cultivate the future demand for bioenergy for BECCS on the same, or less, land area than is currently used globally.

AB  - This paper is a study on a modular smart plant factory integrating intelligent solar module, LED module with high efficiency for plant growth, IoT module control system and image processing technology. The intelligent sun and modules have a corrugated structure, and the angle of the module can be adjusted to obtain a large amount of power generation. It is fully foldable for wider angles during the day and module protection at night. The LED module is designed and manufactured to distribute energy evenly over the entire wavelength range so that high efficiency can be obtained. The control system with IoT convergence technology enables control of all parts related to plant growth such as angle control of solar modules, LED lighting control, temperature/humidity control, and fan control. In particular, the control method is programmed to be controlled by a computer monitoring system and a smartphone app, so there are few places. In addition, this paper developed an image processing algorithm to extract the growth information of lettuce grown in the plant factory. The acquired images were separated into R, G, and B images using Matlab software. The applied algorithms are k-mean and improved morphological image processing. By applying this method, we can determine the area calculation and shipping of lettuce seedlings. As a result of the fusion and application of solar modules, LED modules, and IoT modules, information on plant growth and status was confirmed.

AB  - In plant factories, light is fully controllable for crop production but involves a cost. For efficient lighting, light use efficiency (LUE) should be considered as part of light environment design. The objectives of this study were to evaluate and interpret the light interception, photosynthetic rate, and LUE of lettuces under electrical lights using ray-tracing simulation. The crop architecture model was constructed by 3D scanning, and ray-tracing simulation was used to interpret light interception and photosynthesis. For evaluation of simulation reliability, measured light intensities and photosynthetic rates in a growth chamber were compared with those obtained by simulation at different planting densities. Under several scenarios modeling various factors affecting light environments, changes in light interception and LUE were interpreted. The light intensities and photosynthetic rates obtained by simulation showed good agreement with the measured values, with R-2 > 0.86. With decreasing planting density, the light interception of the central plant increased by approximately 18.7%, but that of neighboring plants decreased by approximately 5.5%. Under the various scenarios, shorter lighting distances induced more heterogenetic light distribution on plants and caused lower light interception. Under a homogenous light distribution, the light intensity was optimal at approximately 360 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) with an LUE of 6.5 g MJ(-1). The results of this study can provide conceptual insights into the design of light environments in plant factories.

AB  - Ophiorrhiza pumila is a medicinal plant distributed on the floors of humid inland forests in subtropical areas and accumulates camptothecin (CPT) in whole plant organs. To elucidate the proper light and air temperature conditions for plant growth and CPT yield, we conducted two experiments under controlled environments. In experiment 1, we measured the net photosynthetic rate (P-n) and transpiration rate (E) of the whole plant O. pumila using an open-type assimilation chamber under different photosynthetic photon flux densities (PPFDs) and air temperatures. The result showed that the combination of an air temperature of 28 degrees C and a PPFD of 100 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) was a good condition for photosynthesis and transpiration. In experiment 2, O. pumila was cultivated for 35 days under three PPFDs and three light periods at an air temperature of 28 degrees C. At a PPFD of 100 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) and a light period of 16 h, growth was accelerated by the generating the lateral shoots and branches, and total CPT content per plant was the highest among these treatments. The present study revealed that the proper PPFD and light period conditions could enhance growth and CPT accumulation of O. pumila.

AB  - Four light treatments (W: white light; EOD-B: end-of-day enhanced blue light; EOD-FR: end-of-day supplementary far-red light; EOD-UV: end-of-day supplementary ultraviolet-A light) were designed to explore the effects of end-of-day (EOD) lightings (30 min before dark period) on leaf color, biomass and phytochemicals accumulation in two lettuce cultivars (Lactuca sativa cv. 'Red butter' and 'Green butter') in artificial light plant factory. EOD-FR stimulated the plant and shoot biomass of two cultivars, and EOD-B suppressed the growth of 'Red butter' but induced higher biomass in 'Green butter'. EOD lightings generated brighter, greener and yellower leaf in 'Red butter' at harvest, but the highest lightness and the deepest redness of 'Green butter' leaf were observed in the middle growth stage. 'Red butter' had prominent higher contents of chlorophylls and carotenoids, while these pigments showed less sensitivity to the interaction of cultivars and EOD lightings. EOD lightings impeded the accumulation of anthocyanin in two cultivars, except EOD-UV slightly increased the anthocyanin contents in 'Green butter'.

AB  - Plant Factories with Artificial Lighting (PFALs) are spreading due to the claimed efficiency in natural resources use, although at the cost of higher energy needs as compared with more traditional food systems. In recent years, research literature on PFAL technological features and management protocols has bloomed, mainly targeting innovation in lighting technologies, growing systems and environmental control units. To date, however, a comprehensive analysis of resource use and environmental impacts associated with PFAL systems is lacking. The present review paper aims at providing valuable insights on PFAL sustainability and compare their applications against current technologies and food systems with a special focus on resource use efficiency.

AB  - LED light sources have been gradually applied in plant factories, but the heat dissipation of LED leads to high energy consumption. Considering the water irrigation systems of plant factories, a cutting copper fiber oriented sintered heat sink (CCFOSHS) is proposed for water cooling of LEDs. The heat transfer and flow performances of CCFOSHS were investigated by experiments, and compared with cutting copper fiber random sintered heat sink (CCFRSHS) and traditional small channel heat sink. Influences of porosity and equivalent diameter of fibers on heat transfer and flow performances of CCFOSHS are analyzed. Results demonstrate that compared to CCFRSHS, heat transfer performances of CCFOSHS are slightly worse, but the direction of fiber causes a lower pressure drop and CCFOSHS has better comprehensive heat transfer performance. With the decrease of porosity, heat transfer performances of CCFOSHS are enhanced slightly, but pressure drops increase distinctly. Heat transfer performances of CCFOSHS are not sensitive to the equivalent diameter of fibers. The smaller equivalent diameter of the fibers leads to a higher pressure drop. Especially when the equivalent diameter of fibers is 195.12 mu m, CCFOSHS with 80% porosity, has better temperature uniformity.

AB  - Ultraviolet B (UV-B) light, as a physical elicitor, can promote the secondary metabolites biosynthesis in plants. We investigated effects of different energy levels of UV-B radiation on growth and bioactive compounds of Crepidiastrum denticulatum. Three-week-old seedlings were grown in a plant factory for 5 weeks. Plants were subjected to different levels of UV-B (0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, and 1.25 W m(-2)), 6 h a day for 6 days. All UV-B treatments had no negative effect on the shoot dry weight; however, relatively high energy treatments (1.0 and 1.25 W m(-2)) inhibited the shoot fresh weight. UV-B light of 0.1, 0.25, and 0.5 W m(-2) did not affect total chlorophyll and H2O2 contents; however, they increased total carotenoid content. On 4 days, 0.25 W m(-2) treatment increased antioxidant capacity, total hydroxycinnamic acids (HCAs) content, and several sesquiterpenes. Treatments with 1.0 and 1.25 W m(-2) increased total carotenoid, total HCAs, and H2O2 contents, and destroyed chlorophyll pigments, reducing maximum quantum yield of photosystem II and causing visible damage to leaves. Partial least squares discrimination analysis (PLS-DA) showed that secondary metabolites were distinguishably changed according to energy levels of UV-B. The potential of 0.25 W m(-2) UV-B for the efficient production of bioactive compounds without growth inhibition in C. denticulatum was identified.

AB  - In Vertical Farms with Artificial Lighting (VFALs), optimal light management is a crucial determinant of both economic and environmental viability. Applications of LED technologies to plant cultivation are still recent, and research has to date mainly targeted the definition of optimal spectral and light intensity features. On the other hand, despite the relevant implications on production costs, literature on optimal photoperiod management is to date limited. Indeed, the number of hours per day correlates with the total light supplied to the crop - expressed as Daily Light Integral (DLI) - and the associated energetic costs. The present study aims at defining how photoperiods of 16 h d(-1) (DLI= 14.4 mol m(-2) d(-1)), 20 h d(-1) (DLI= 18 mol m(-2) d(-1)) and 24 h d(-1) (DLI= 21.6 mol m(-2) d(-1)) of light affect growth performances and resource use efficiency in leafy vegetables and herbs, represented by lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.), basil (Ocimum basilicum L.), rocket (Eruca sativa Mill.), and chicory (Cichorium intybus L.). Plants were cultivated indoor under a red (R) and blue (B) LED light (RB=3, photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD)= 250 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)). Photoperiod variations' effects differed according to the considered plant species. In lettuce and chicory, the adoption of a DLI of 14.4 mol m(-2) d(-1) at 16 h d(-1) photoperiod resulted in a greater plants fresh biomass and leaf area, which also contributed to generally obtain higher energy use efficiency (fresh biomass per unit of electricity input), light use efficiency (dry biomass per unit of light input) and, in chicory, also water use efficiency (fresh biomass per liter of water consumed). Contrarily, although photoperiod variations did not affect basil and rocket growth parameters (e.g., fresh biomass and leaf area ) and the plant capacity to transform resources (e.g., water use efficiency and light use efficiency), energy use efficiency in basil also presented a downward trend in response to growing DLI. Accordingly, the adoption of a DLI of 14.4 mol m(-2) d(-1) at 16 h d(-1) photoperiod resulted to be the optimal option among the ones tested in the presented research.

AB  - There is a need for plant growing media that can support a beneficial microbial root environment to ensure that optimal plant growth properties can be achieved. We investigated the effect of five rhizosphere bacterial community inocula (BCI S1-5) that were collected at three open field organic farms and two soilless farms on the performance of lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.). The lettuce plants were grown in ten different plant growing media (M1-10) composed of 60% v/v peat (black peat or white peat), 20% v/v other organics (coir pith or wood fiber), 10% v/v composted materials (composted bark or green waste compost) and 10% v/v inorganic materials (perlite or sand), and one commercial plant growing medium inside a plant factory with artificial lighting. Fractional factorial design of experiments analysis revealed that the bacterial community inoculum, plant growing medium composition, and their interaction determine plant performance. The impact of bacterial amendments on the plant phenotype relied on the bacterial source. For example, S3 treatment significantly increased lettuce shoot fresh weight (+57%), lettuce head area (+29%), root fresh weight (+53%), and NO3-content (+53%), while S1 treatment significantly increased lettuce shoot dry weight (+15%), total phenolic content (+65%), and decreased NO3-content (-67%). However, the effectiveness of S3 and S1 treatment depended on plant growing medium composition. Principal component analysis revealed that shoot fresh weight, lettuce head area, root fresh weight, and shoot dry weight were the dominant parameters contributing to the variation in the interactions. The dominant treatments were S3-M8, S1-M7, S2-M4, the commercial plant growing medium, S1-M2, and S3-M10. Proper selection of plant growing medium composition is critical for the efficacy of bacterial amendments and achieving optimal plant performance inside a plant factory with artificial lighting.

AB  - Plant factories or vertical farms with LED lighting have been developed to grow fresh and high-quality vegetables inside urban buildings without being restricted by climate and land. Environmental control technologies are developing rapidly for improving productivity of leafy vegetables in plant factories. However, tipburn issues are also rising with the increase of plant growth rate and this reduces the product quality and its marketable value. The tip-burned parts of the vegetable must be removed manually at harvest, which causes more yield loss and labor cost. In this research, the effects of light intensities with different total light integrals (TLI) or with the same TLI on lettuce growth and tipburn occurrence were investigated. In the first experiment, three tight intensities: 85, 125, and 187 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) were applied to the rapid growth stage of romaine lettuce plants; and in the second experiment, an average light intensity of 150 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) was applied in four different lighting patterns to the plants. The results show that plant biomass clearly increased with increases of light intensity (or TLI) but was not affected by different lighting patterns under the same TLI. Leaf areas were not significantly affected by different light intensities under the present experimental conditions, indicating that plants firstly expand leaf area (rather than increase thickness) to increase light interception when light intensity is low. Tipburn occurred during 23 similar to 26 days after sowing and its occurrence was positively correlated with light intensity and relative growth rate (RGR). Regression analysis indicated that there could be a key threshold value in RGR which induces tipburn. To control an RGR value lower than the threshold value during 23 similar to 26 days after sowing would be critical for limiting tipburn occurrence.

AB  - Energy use efficiency in greenhouse and indoor plant factory system is greatly affected by outdoor climates, structure properties, operating conditions and product types. Energy use efficiency for two greenhouse cases and two indoor plant factory cases were compared in simulation with annual lettuce biomass yield and energy consumption including lighting, heating, and cooling for six geographic locations with different climates (Duluth, Minnesota; Seattle, Washington; Phoenix, Arizona; Miami, Florida; Abu Dhabi, UAE; and Riyadh, KSA). The energy balance of a greenhouse was simulated including Greenhouse 1 (GH_1) with a shading curtain (50% shade percentage) deployed during high radiation seasons and Greenhouse 2 (GH_2) with a constant daily light integral level (DLI) of 15 mol m(-2) d(-1) achieved by supplemental lights and variable shading controls. In indoor plant factory model, two cases Indoor Plant Factory 1 (IPF_1) and Indoor Plant Factory 2 (IPF_2) were simulated with EnergyPlus, a building simulation program, with the DLIs of 13 mol m(-2) d(-1) and 15 mol m(-2 )d(-1) respectively. Using LED lights with high efficacy (2.5 mu mol J(-1)), indoor plant factories were determined to be superior to greenhouses in cold climates with energy use efficiency as high as 0.13 kg kWh(-1) and 0.14 kg kWh(-1) respectively in Duluth and Seattle compared to greenhouse cases with 0.10 kg kWh(-1) and 0.11 kg kWh(-1) respectively. In hot climates greenhouses are significantly more efficient than indoor plant factories, with the highest energy use efficiency of 0.35 kg kWh(-1) in Miami. Parameters of indoor plant factory systems, including heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) economizers, the number of tiers of production shelves, lettuce plant transpiration rate, and light efficacy, were evaluated for their impacts on energy usage and effectiveness for energy savings. Choosing LED lights with high efficacy was recommended to effectively reduce the electricity usage and to enhance energy use efficiency for indoor plant factories.

AB  - The increasing population and continuous urbanization make food security prominent in sustainable development. It is important to develop economic and resource-efficient farming solutions to meet food demand. Renewable energy and waste valorization may bring benefits to build sustainable food production systems and facilitate circular economy. This work aims to develop a decision support framework for the stakeholders to quantitatively assess and optimize their urban farming systems for efficient investment and operation. The proposed framework is based on a holistic system model that considers the energy and material consumption in vegetable production processes and the economic and environmental performance of urban farming systems. In the multi-dimensional assessment model, the net present value and cradle-to-gate CO2 emission, water consumption, and land occupation of different configurations of urban farming systems were assessed. In a further development, the assessment model was embedded in an optimization framework to identify the optimal system design and operation. The optimal crop mix and the corresponding cultivation set points (such as temperature, humidity, irradiance, illumination time, and CO2 concentration) for the farming modules were determined via optimization. To demonstrate the proposed framework, a case study on the design and operation of a vertical farm in Singapore was carried out. The case study examined alternative farming systems with glass-enclosed vs window-free structural design, grid vs solar photovoltaic (PV) energy supply, and traditional chemical fertilizers vs food waste compost fertilization. Results showed that plant-factory farming systems integrated with solar PV and beer-residue-derived fertilizer could be a promising and sustainable farming solution for Singapore as a tropical megacity.

AB  - Facing food insecurity and overuse of resources due to effects of climate change, humanity needs to find new ways to secure food production and produce close to consumers. Vertical farming, where plants are grown in vertical arrays inside buildings with help of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) components, could contribute to solving this issue. Such systems integrate heterogeneous devices on different computing layers and acquire a lot of data to monitor and optimize the production process. We created an indoor testing unit in which growing conditions can be monitored and controlled to optimize growth of microgreens. This setup includes an Indoor Farming Support as a Service (IFSaaS) prototype that provides safe and secure monitoring and controlling, as well as self-adaption of an indoor farming system. In this article we provide information about the combination of most suitable technologies.

AB  - Controlled environment crop production recommendations often use the daily light integral (DLI) to quantify the light requirements of specific crops. Sole-source electric lighting, used in plant factories, and supplemental electric lighting, used in greenhouses, may be required to attain a specific DLI. Electric lighting is wasteful if not provided in a way that promotes efficient photochemistry. The quantum yield of photosystem II (phi(PSII)), the fraction of absorbed light used for photochemistry, decreases with increasing photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD). Thus, we hypothesized that the daily photochemical integral (DPI), the total electron transport through photosystem II (PSII) integrated over 24 h, would increase if the same DLI was provided at a lower PPFD over a longer photoperiod. To test this, phi(PSII)and the electron transport rate (ETR) of lettuce (Lactuca sativa'Green Towers') were measured in a growth chamber at DLIs of 15 and 20 mol m(-2)d(-1)over photoperiods ranging from 7 to 22 h. This resulted in PPFDs of 189 to 794 mu mol m(-2)s(-1). The phi(PSII)decreased from 0.67 to 0.28 and ETR increased from 55 to 99 mu mol m(-2)s(-1)as PPFD increased from 189 to 794 mu mol m(-2)s(-1). The DPI increased linearly as the photoperiod increased, but the magnitude of this response depended on DLI. With a 7-h photoperiod, the DPI was approximate to 2.7 mol m(-2)d(-1), regardless of DLI. However, with a 22-h photoperiod, the DPI was 4.54 mol m(-2)d(-1)with a DLI of 15 mol m(-2)d(-1)and 5.78 mol m(-2)d(-1)with a DLI of 20 mol m(-2)d(-1). Our hypothesis that DPI can be increased by providing the same DLI over longer photoperiods was confirmed.

AB  - St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatumL.) is a medicinal plant that alleviates depression and other disorders due to its abundance of active ingredients. Hyperforin, rutin, and melatonin are the main active, and important, ingredients in St. John's wort that alleviate depression. In order to investigate the optimal conditions for accumulating these active ingredients, design of experiments and response surface methodology (RSM) was employed in this study. Two-month-old St John's wort plants were cultivated in growth chambers at varying temperatures, light intensities, and nutrient solution concentrations before analysis by HPLC, for determining differences in hyperforin, rutin, and melatonin content. The results showed that hyperforin and rutin contents were significantly influenced by temperature (18-23 degrees C) and light intensity (49-147 mu mol m(-2)s(-1)photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD)), whereas Hoagland's nutrient solution concentration (25-75%) had little effect. The accumulation of melatonin might not be influenced by cultivation conditions. Light intensity and temperature are easily controlled environmental factors in artificial cultivation, both of which are related to secondary metabolite production in the plant. Based on RSM, the optimal conditions for the accumulation of hyperforin and rutin were obtained. The maximum content of hyperforin was 5.6 mg/g, obtained at a temperature of 19 degrees C, a nutrient solution concentration of 45%, and a light intensity of 49 mu mol m(-2)s(-1)PPFD. The maximum content of rutin was 3.8 mg/g obtained at a temperature of 18 degrees C, a nutrient solution concentration of 50%, and a light intensity of 147 mu mol m(-2)s(-1)PPFD. This evaluation of suitable conditions for the accumulation of bioactive compounds in St. John's wort can be applied to plant factories on a large scale.

AB  - In recent years, research on light emitting diodes (LEDs) has highlighted their great potential as a lighting system for plant growth, development and metabolism control. The suitability of LED devices for plant cultivation has turned the technology into a main component in controlled or closed plant-growing environments, experiencing an extremely fast development of horticulture LED metrics. In this context, the present study aims to provide an insight into the current global horticulture LED industry and the present features and potentialities for LEDs' applications. An updated review of this industry has been integrated through a database compilation of 301 manufacturers and 1473 LED lighting systems for plant growth. The research identifies Europe (40%) and North America (29%) as the main regions for production. Additionally, the current LED luminaires' lifespans show 10 and 30% losses of light output after 45,000 and 60,000 working hours on average, respectively, while the vast majority of worldwide LED lighting systems present efficacy values ranging from 2 to 3 mu mol J(-1) (70%). Thus, an update on the status of the horticultural LED sector, LEDs' applications and metrics, and the intense innovation are described and discussed.

AB  - In order to improve plant factories, an appropriate control system on fertilization is urgently required. An automatic management system to control nutrient concentration was constructed using a programmable logic controller (PLC) and ion selective electrodes (ISEs) of nitrate, phosphate, and potassium ion. The concentration of nutrient components in a culture solution was monitored using these ISEs. When the concentration of the nutrient components diminished to the threshold set as an optimum condition (0.1 - 2.0 mM), an appropriate amount of a concentrated solution of each nutrient component was added to the culture solution using solenoid valves connected with the PLC. The present cultivation system was simply constructed without any computers and pumps. Three kinds of automatic control systems simultaneously worked and did not influence each other.

AB  - There is a growing interest in the impact of light intensity and temperature on vegetable growth and dietary quality characteristics. Lettuce (Lactuca sativaL.), as one of the model vegetables in plant factories, was grown under two light levels (G(1): 160 mu mol m(-2)s(-1), G(2): 200 mu mol m(-2)s(-1)) with different day/night temperatures (T-1: 20 +/- 1 degrees C/15 +/- 1 degrees C, T-2: 24 +/- 1 degrees C/19 +/- 1 degrees C) to investigate mutual effects of light intensity and temperature on its growth and quality properties. The results revealed that the T(2)G(2)treatment showed higher plant height, biomass and net photosynthetic rate, while T(1)G(2)resulted in decreased leaf area and lower maximum photochemical efficiency of photosystem II (Fv/Fm) compared to T(1)G(1). Simultaneous increases in light intensity and temperature based on T(1)G(1)significantly increased the contents of anthocyanin, vitamin C (Vc) and soluble protein by 58%, 21% and 172%, respectively. The higher light intensity promoted the nutritional values of lettuce, characterised by lower nitrate level and soluble protein contents. Principal component analysis showed a negative collinearity between the nitrate content and soluble protein and Vc contents. In conclusion, light intensity and temperature co-regulated the lettuce's growth and development, and their simultaneous increases better for growth and nutritional values of lettuce. These results provide a better understanding of the cultivation of plants in an artificial plant factory while maintaining yield and quality.

AB  - Light intensity and nitrogen concentration in nutrient solutions are two main factors affecting the growth and nutritional quality of lettuce(Lactuca sativaL.). This study investigated the method of regulating vegetable cultivation through the interactive control of the light environment and solution ratio. A quadratic regression orthogonal model was developed to understand the role of light intensity (43 to 237 mu mol m(-2)s(-1)) and nitrogen concentration (4.3 to 23.7 mmol L-1) in lettuce growth. Dry weight, vitamin C, and nitrate contents were measured and modelled to understand the coupling effect of light intensity and nitrogen concentration on lettuce. The optimised conditions for lettuce growth were 237 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)of light intensity and 9.2 mmol L(-1)of nitrogen concentration, and these conditions were predicted to produce lettuce with an average dry biomass of 3.9 g plant(-1), 149.9 mu g g(-1)of Vitamin C, and 212.1 mu g g(-1)of nitrate content based on their respective weighting factors (0.50, 0.25, and 0.25). The lettuce yield and quality were verified using the modelled optimised growth conditions and the lettuce grown was indeed more nutritional compared to the commercially available lettuce. The findings are important for mass production of lettuce in plant factories and greenhouses.

AB  - BACKGROUND Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are widely used in closed-type plant production systems to improve biomass and accumulate bioactive compounds in plants. Perilla has been commonly used as herbal medicine because of its health-promoting effects. This study aimed to investigate the physiological and biochemical responses of green and red perilla under various visible-light spectra. RESULTS Results showed that red (R) LEDs improved fresh weights of shoots and roots, plant height, internode length, node number and leaf area, as well as photosynthetic rate of green and red perilla plants compared to blue (B) LEDs and RB combined LEDs. Meanwhile, B resulted in higher stomatal conductance, transpiration rate and Fv/Fm compared to R. Supplementation of green (G) and far-red (FR) did not enhance perilla growth. Reduction or absence of B decreased leaf thickness, adaxial and abaxial epidermis, and palisade and spongy mesophyll. Total phenolic content, antioxidant capacity, rosmarinic acid content and caffeic acid content of green perilla were higher under R, R8B2 and RGB + FR, while greater values were obtained in red perilla under R. Accumulation of perillaldehyde, luteolin and apigenin presented different trends from those of rosmarinic and caffeic acids in both cultivars. CONCLUSIONS Growth and accumulation of bioactive compounds in green perilla were greater than in red perilla under similar light quality, and R LEDs or a higher R ratio in combination treatments were suitable for cultivating high-quality green and red perilla plants in closed-type plant factories.

AB  - Scaling current cereal production to a growing global population will be a challenge. Wheat supplies approximately one-fifth of the calories and protein for human diets. Vertical farming is a possible promising option for increasing future wheat production. Here we show that wheat grown on a single hectare of land in a 10-layer indoor vertical facility could produce from 700 +/- 40 t/ha (measured) to a maximum of 1,940 +/- 230 t/ha (estimated) of grain annually under optimized temperature, intensive artificial light, high CO2 levels, and a maximum attainable harvest index. Such yields would be 220 to 600 times the current world average annual wheat yield of 3.2 t/ha. Independent of climate, season, and region, indoor wheat farming could be environmentally superior, as less land area is needed along with reuse of most water, minimal use of pesticides and herbicides, and no nutrient losses. Although it is unlikely that indoor wheat farming will be economically competitive with current market prices in the near future, it could play an essential role in hedging against future climate or other unexpected disruptions to the food system. Nevertheless, maximum production potential remains to be confirmed experimentally, and further technological innovations are needed to reduce capital and energy costs in such facilities.

AB  - To achieve clean and high-quality spinach production, the effects of daily light integral (DLI) and light spectrum on growth, nutritional quality, and energy yield of hydroponic spinach (Spinacia oleraceaL.) were investigated in a closed plant factory under light-emitting diode (LED) lighting. The hydroponic spinach plants were grown under 16 combinations of four levels of DLI (11.5, 14.4, 17.3, and 20.2 mol m(-2)day(-1)) with four light spectra: LED lamps with ratio of red light to blue light (R:B ratio) of 0.9, 1.2, and 2.2 and fluorescent lamps with R:B ratio of 1.8 as control. The results show that total fresh and dry weights, energy yield, and light energy use efficiency (LUE) of harvested spinach were higher under D17.3-L1.2 treatment compared to other treatments. The higher net photosynthetic rates were shown at DLI of 17.3 mol m(-2)day(-1) regardless of light quality. Higher vitamin C contents of spinach in all LED treatments were obtained compared with the control. L1.2 treatments with higher fraction of blue light led to more vitamin C content, lower nitrate content, and higher LUE independent of DLI. L2.2 treatment with more fraction of red light was beneficial to reduce oxalate accumulation. Power consumption based on increased total fresh weight under LED lamps with R:B ratio of 1.2 in different DLIs was over 38% lower than that under the fluorescent lamps and 1.73 kWh per 100 g FW at DLI of 17.3 mol m(-2)day(-1). In conclusion, lighting environment in DLI of 17.3 mol m(-2)day(-1)using LED lamps with R:B ratio of 1.2 is suggested for the design of a LED plant factory for hydroponic spinach production.

AB  - This study aimed to determine the optimal indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) concentration in a nutrient solution to increase the bioactive compounds while enhancing the plant growth ofA. rugosagrown hydroponically. Twenty-eight-day-old plants were transplanted in a plant factory for 32 days. The plants were subjected to various IAA concentrations (10(-11), 10(-9), 10(-7), and 10(-5)M) from 8 days after transplanting, and the control treatment (without IAA). Shoot and root fresh weights were effectively improved under 10(-7)and 10(-9)IAA treatments. Leaf gas exchange parameters were increased under 10(-7)and 10(-9)IAA treatments. Four of the IAA treatments, except 10(-11)IAA treatment, significantly increased the rosmarinic acid (RA) concentration, as well as the tilianin concentration was significantly increased at all IAA treatments, compared with that of the control. Especially, the tilianin concentration of the 10(-11)IAA treatment was significantly (1.8 times) higher than that of the control. The IAA treatments at 10(-5)and 10(-7)significantly raised the acacetin concentrations (1.6- and 1.7-times, respectively) compared to those of the control. These results suggested that 10(-7)concentration of IAA in a nutrient solution was effective for enhancing plant growth and increasing bioactive compounds inA. rugosa, which offers an effective strategy for increasing phytochemical production in a plant factory.

AB  - The increased demand for food and the challenge for space for agriculture production in urban centers have made the vertical growth system an interesting trend. Agriculture is no longer only the horizontal, traditional, and soil grown method. Urban agriculture has created ways for inner city growers to be able to farm in a restricted space. Vertical farming is the practice of growing crops, especially leafy vegetables such as lettuce, in vertically stacked layers, as this results in significantly higher plant population per unit area. Two research trials were conducted in the fall of 2018 and the spring of 2019 to determine the effect of substrate properties and fertilizers on lettuce yield to optimize the urban production of lettuce. Three substrates (P3 + CF7 = Perlite 30%: Coco fiber 70%, PB7 + C3 = Pine Bark 70%: Compost 30%, and PB9 + C1 = Pine Bark 90%: Compost 10%) along with full and half rates of a fertilizer blend (VertiGro Organics fermented molasses, Ohrstrom's Maxicrop liquid seaweed, and organic mineral blend) were evaluated on fresh and dried weight yield of lettuce. Substrate physical properties (air space, water holding capacity, total porosity, and bulk density) and substrate volumetric water content were also determined. 'Nevada' and 'Optima' lettuce varieties showed similar yield responses (fresh and dried weight) to substrate and fertilizer rates in both trials. In the fall 2018 trial, the highest fresh weight was observed in substrate PB7 + C3 with half fertilizer rate, with a mean plant weight of 41.13 g and 49.75 g for 'Optima' and 'Nevada', respectively. The least mean fresh weight was observed in half fertilizer rate of substrate P3 + CF7. For the spring 2019 trial, PB7 + C3 in half fertilizer strength gave the highest fresh weight for 'Optima' and 'Nevada' (45.64 g and 41.13 g, respectively). These values were statistically comparable to all other treatments except for substrate P3 + CF7 in full and half fertilizer which gave the least mean fresh weight. Volumetric water content in substrates P3 + CF7 recorded the highest average, while PB7 + C3 gave the least. Higher water holding capacity, total porosity, and lower airspace were observed in substrate P3 + CF7. Higher airspace was observed in PB9 + C1 but was comparable to PB7 + C3. PB7 + C3 gave the highest bulk density in both trials.

AB  - Light -emitting diodes (LEDs) have been widely applied in the controlled environment agriculture, which are characterized by relatively narrow -band spectra and energetical efficiency. Most recently, the spectrum of Sunlike LEDs has been engineered and it closely resembles solar spectrum in the range of photosynthetic active radiation (PAR, 400-700 nm). To investigate how plant growth responses to the spectrum of Sunlike LEDs, cucumber and lettuce plants were cultivated and their responses were compared with the conventional white LEDs as well as composite of red and blue LEDs (RB, R/B ratio was 9:1). We observed that although Sunlike LEDs resulted in a longer stem in cucumber, dry weight and leaf area were similar as those under RB LEDs, and significantly higher than those under white LEDs. Moreover, cucumber leaves grown under Sunlike and white LEDs showed higher photosynthetic capacity than those grown under RB LEDs. For lettuce, plants grown under Sunlike LEDs showed larger leaf area and higher dry weight than the other two treatments. However, the leaf photosynthetic capacity of lettuce grown under Sunlike LEDs was the lowest. In this context, the spectrum induced plant functions are species -dependent. Furthermore, the three types of LEDs show distinct light spectra and they are different in many aspects. Therefore, it is difficult to attribute the different plant responses to certain specific light spectra. We conclude that plants grown under Sunlike LEDs exhibit larger leaf area, which may be due to some specific spectrum distributions (such as more far -red radiation), and consequently are favorable for light interception and therefore result in greater production.

AB  - Vertical farming is a type of indoor agriculture where plants are cultivated in stacked systems. It forms a rapidly growing sector with new emerging technologies. Indoor farms often use soil-free techniques such as hydroponics and aeroponics. Aeroponics involves the application to roots of a nutrient aerosol, which can lead to greater plant productivity than hydroponic cultivation. Aeroponics is thought to resolve a variety of plant physiological constraints that occur within hydroponic systems. We synthesize existing studies of the physiology and development of crops cultivated under aeroponic conditions and identify key knowledge gaps. We identify future research areas to accelerate the sustainable intensification of vertical farming using aeroponic systems.

AB  - Advocates of indoor vertical farming have pitched the enterprise as key to the future of food, an opportunity to use technological innovation to increase local food production, bolster urban sustainability, and create a world in which there is "real food" for everyone. At the same time, critics have raised concerns about the costs, energy usage, social impacts, and overall agricultural viability of these efforts, with some insisting that existing low-tech and community-based solutions of the "good food movement" offer a better path forward. Drawing from a mix of participant observation and other qualitative methods, this article examines the work of Square Roots, a Brooklyn-based indoor vertical farming company cofounded by entrepreneur Kimbal Musk and technology CEO Tobias Peggs. In an effort to create a market for what I refer to as "techno-local food," Square Roots pitches its products as simultaneously "real" and technologically optimized. As a way to build trust in these novel products and better connect consumers with producers, Square Roots leans on transparency as a publicity tool. The company's Transparency Timeline, for instance, uses photos and a narrative account of a product's life-cycle to tell its story "from seed-to-store," allowing potential customers to "know their farmer." The information Square Roots shares, however, offers a narrow peek into its operations, limiting the view of operational dynamics that could help determine whether the company is actually living up to its promise. The research provides a clear case study of an organization using transparency-publicity as market strategy, illustrating the positive possibilities that such an approach can bring to consumer engagement, while also demonstrating how the tactic can distract from a company's stated social responsibility goals.

AB  - Despite global shifts in attitudes toward sustainability and increasing awareness of human impact on the environment, projected population growth and climate change require technological adaptations to ensure food and resource security at a global scale. Although desert areas have long been proposed as ideal sites for solar electricity generation, only recently have efforts shifted toward development of specialized and regionally focused agriculture in these extreme environments. In coastal regions of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), the most abundant resources are consistent intense sunlight and saline sea water. MENA coastal regions hold incredible untapped potential for agriculture driven by the combination of key emerging technologies in future greenhouse concepts: transparent infrared collecting solar panels and low energy salt water cooling. These technologies can be combined to create greenhouses that drive regionally relevant agriculture in this extreme environment, especially when the target crops are salt-tolerant plants and algal biomass. Future controlled environment agriculture concepts will not compete for municipal fresh water and can be readily integrated into local human/livestock/fisheries food chains. With strategic technological implementation, marginal lands in these environments could participate in production of biomass, sustainable energy generation, and the circular carbon economy. The goal of this perspective is to reframe the idea of these environments as extreme, to having incredible untapped development potential.

AB  - Understanding the responses of plant growth and secondary metabolite synthesis to different light wavelengths is important for optimizing lighting conditions for vegetable production in indoor vertical farms. Basil (Ocimum basilicum) 'Improved Genovese Compact' (green leaf) and 'Red Rubin' (purple leaf), green mustard 'Amara' (Brassica carinata), redmustard 'Red Giant' (Brassica juncea), green kale 'Siberian' (Brassica napus var. pabularia), and red kale 'Scarlet' (Brassica oleracea), which are high-value and multifunctional culinary herbs and leafy greens, were used to characterize the effects of red (R), blue (B), and green (G) wavelengths on plant photosynthesis, morphology, biomass production, and secondary metabolites accumulation. Light quality treatments consisted of three R and B light combinations, R88B12 (the proportions of R and B wavelengths were 88% and 12%, respectively), R76B24, and R51B49, and two white light combinations, R(44)B(12)G(44) (the proportions of R, B, and G wavelengths were 44%, 12%, and 44%, respectively) and R(35)B(24)G(41). Experiments were conducted in a walk-in growth room with a photosynthetic photon flux density set at 224 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1) and a 16-hour photoperiod. Results indicated that the net photosynthesis in purple basil and green kale were positively correlated with B proportions (BP), and that higher BP increased the relative chlorophyll concentration in purple basil and red kale. In contrast, higher BP suppressed stem elongation and leaf expansion and reduced shoot biomass in all tested species except red mustard. Higher BP increased phytochemical concentrations but decreased the total amounts of phytochemicals per plant. For all basil and brassica (Brassica sp.) cultivars, the inclusion of G wavelengths decreased shoot biomass compared with that of plants grown under R and B light combinations with similar BP. Inclusion of G wavelengths stimulated stem elongation in green basil and green mustard under 12% BP; whereas it suppressed stem elongation in purple basil, green kale, red kale, and green mustard under 24% BP. The effects on phytochemical accumulation were species-specific for the inclusion of G wavelengths. Considering biomass production, nutritional values, and working environment for growers, a white light with lower BP and G proportions is recommended for culinary herbs and Brassica leafy greens production at vertical farms.

AB  - Ginseng, a semi-shade perennial plant, is greatly affected by light. However, light quality has only been studied in a few papers involving growth tests under monochromatic light or based on hairy root cultures. A plant factory with light-emitting diodes (LEDs) may provide high precision and standardization of ginseng seedlings for transplanting, and plant responses to light quality should be investigated for designing the optimal lighting conditions for this environment. In this study, various ratios of red light (R):blue light (B) were set from 100:0 to 0:100% at the same photosynthetic photon flux density of 75 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). As R increased, the shoot length became longer from R75B25, resulting in the single treatment of R being 1.68 times that of B. Compared to monochromatic R or B treatments, the overall growth of ginseng seedlings in R50B50 treatment increased. In the mesophyll structure, mixed light as R50B50 or while LEDs increased starch grains, and only R treatment led to dense chloroplasts in palisade and spongy parenchyma cells. Increasing R ratios had negative effects on CO(2)assimilation rate (A(N)), light-saturated net photosynthesis rate (A(sat)), and chlorophyll parameters. The higher the R ratio, the higher the ginsenoside content in leaves, while roots were less affected by spectral changes. Monochromatic R induced malformation and senescence of ginseng leaves, while the addition of 25% B was sufficient to prevent the abnormal development of leaves and dysfunctional photosynthetic operation of ginseng seedlings. The results suggest that combinations of R and B should be considered when designing artificial lighting systems for a closed-type plant factory since R affects the morphological characteristics and ginsenoside content of ginseng seedlings.

AB  - Light is a crucial element for plant growth and production. High-pressure sodium (HPS) lamps are considered not very electrically efficient as they generate high radiant heat, and as a consequence, there has been a lot of interest in replacing HPS lamps with new more efficient lighting sources in the form of light-emitting diodes (LEDs). LEDs have a linear photon output with the electrical input current, and this great feature allows the design of lighting arrays that match the plant's needs. In the current study, light spectrum absorbance of pigments extracted from 14 plant species was analyzed. Two absorbance peaks were observed in the Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) region: one at 435 nm and the other at 665 nm. The light spectrum array was designed to produce the spectrum absorbed by basil pigments. This included the use of new wavelengths of 435 +/- 5 nm to cover the blue region. Moreover, the ratio between blue and red was considered to match the absorbance of basil pigment. The use of a light spectrum that matches the plant absorbance significantly improved the investigated physiological parameters and increased the growth yield of basil. Moreover, this is the first to confirm the great positive impact of using 435 nm light spectrum in comparison with the commercially widely used 450 nm LED spectrum. This investigation has great scientific and commercial applications in the field of indoor faming and plant factory systems.

AB  - The interacted effects of photoperiod and nutrient solution concentrations (NSCs) on nutritional quality and antioxidant and mineral content in lettuce were investigated in this study. There were a total of nine treatments by three photoperiods (12 h/12 h, 15 h/9 h, and 18 h/6 h), with a combination of three NSCs (1/4, 1/2, and 3/4 NSC). The contents of photosynthetic pigment, mineral element, and nutritional quality were markedly affected by the combination of photoperiod and NSC. The highest leaf number and plant weight were found in lettuce under the combination of 18-0.25X. There was a higher content of photosynthetic pigment in treatment of 15-0.25X. Shorter photoperiod (12 h/12 h and 15 h/9 h) and NSC (1/4 and 1/2 NSC) contributed to reduced nitrate contents and higher contents of free amino acid, soluble protein, and vitamin C. Longer photoperiod and lower NSC could increase soluble sugar content. The content of total P, K, and Ca exhibited a similar trend under the combination of photoperiod and NSC, with a higher content at 3/4 NSC under different photoperiods. Lower contents of total Zn and N were found under longer photoperiod. Moreover, higher antioxidant contents, including 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), value of ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), flavonoid, polyphenol, and anthocyanin were observed under shorter photoperiod, with the peak under 12-0.50X. Generally, 12-0.50X might be the optimal treatment for the improvement of the nutritional quality of lettuce in a plant factory that produced high-quality vegetables.

AB  - Irrigation management continues to be an important issue for tomato cultivation, especially in plant factories. Accurate and timely assessment of tomato leaf water status is a key factor in enabling appropriate irrigation, which can save nutrition solution and labor. In recent decades, hyperspectral imaging has been widely used as a nondestructive measurement method in agriculture to obtain plant biological information. The objective of this research was to establish an approach to obtain the tomato leaf water status-specifically, the relative water content (WC) and equivalent water thickness (MC)-for five different tomato cultivars in real time by using hyperspectral imaging. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and two-band vegetation index (TBI) analyses were performed on the tomato leaf raw relative reflection (RAW), the inversion-logarithm relative reflection (LOG), and the first derivative of relative reflection (DIFF) from wavelengths of 900 nm to 1700 nm. The best regression model for WC assessment was obtained by TBI regression using DIFF at wavelengths of 1410 nm and 1520 nm, and the best regression model for MC assessment was obtained by NDVI regression using RAW at wavelengths of 1300 nm and 1310 nm. Higher model performance was obtained with MC assessment than with WC assessment. The results will help improve our understanding of the relationship between hyperspectral reflectance and leaf water status.

AB  - In this study, effects of high light irradiation (HLI, 500 mu mol m(-2).s(-)(1)) duration in the middle of light period (16 h, 150 mu mol m(-2).s(-1)) provided by red (R) and blue (B) LEDs (4R:1B) on the growth, nutritional quality, and oxidative stress of hydroponic purple leaf lettuce grown in an environmentally controlled plant factory were examined on the 10th and 20th day after treatment. set up five treatments with 0 h (CK), 0.5 h (HL0.5), 1 h (HL1), 2 h (HL2), and 4 h (HL4) HLI, respectively. We found that the shoot fresh weight of lettuce increased first and then decreased with the prolongation of HLI duration, whether in the early or late growth stage. On the 10th day after treatment, the root fresh weight and specific leaf weight of lettuce increased linearly with the prolongation of HLI duration, while the shoot/root ratio decreased linearly. On the 20th day after treatment, the lettuce of HL1 had the highest shoot fresh weight, leaf area, and shoot dry weight, followed by HL2. Besides, HL4 promoted the accumulation of soluble sugar, anthocyanin, flavonoid, and total phenolic simultaneously decreased the maximum quantum efficiency compared with others on the 10th day after treatment. On the 20th day after treatment, HL0.5 and HL4 stimulated the accumulation anthocyanin, flavonoid, total phenolic, and ascorbic acid compared with other treatments. The results showed that short-term HLI promotes biomass production and secondary metabolite accumulation, but HL4 caused photo-oxidative damage to lettuce. Therefore, lettuce growth and qualifies can be purposely adjusted by adopting different duration of HLI provided by red and blue light in the plant factory, also these responses depended on lettuce growth stage closely.

AB  - Proximal sensors in controlled environment agriculture (CEA) are used to monitor plant growth, yield, and water consumption with non-destructive technologies. Rapid and continuous monitoring of environmental and crop parameters may be used to develop mathematical models to predict crop response to microclimatic changes. Here, we applied the energy cascade model (MEC) on green- and red-leaf butterhead lettuce (Lactuca sativa L. var. capitata). We tooled up the model to describe the changing leaf functional efficiency during the growing period. We validated the model on an independent dataset with two different vapor pressure deficit (VPD) levels, corresponding to nominal (low VPD) and off-nominal (high VPD) conditions. Under low VPD, the modified model accurately predicted the transpiration rate (RMSE = 0.10 Lm(-2)), edible biomass (RMSE = 6.87 g m(-2)), net-photosynthesis (rBIAS = 34%), and stomatal conductance (rBIAS = 39%). Under high VPD, the model overestimated photosynthesis and stomatal conductance (rBIAS = 76-68%). This inconsistency is likely due to the empirical nature of the original model, which was designed for nominal conditions. Here, applications of the modified model are discussed, and possible improvements are suggested based on plant morpho-physiological changes occurring in sub-optimal scenarios.

AB  - The medicinal plant,Ophiorrhiza pumila, naturally grows on the floors of humid inland forests in subtropical areas. It accumulates camptothecin (CPT), which is used as an anti-tumor agent, in all organs. We investigated the optimal hydroponic root-zone environments for growth and CPT accumulation inO. pumilain a plant factory. In experiment 1, to determine the appropriate nutrient solution concentration (NSC),O. pumilawas cultivated using four concentrations (0.125, 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 times) of a commercial solution for 63 days after the start of treatment (DAT). The electrical conductivity of these NSCs was 0.6, 0.9, 1.5, and 2.7 dS m(-1), respectively. The total dry weights at 0.25 and 0.5 NSCs were higher than those at the other two NSCs. CPT content at 0.25 NSC was significantly higher than those at other NSCs. In experiment 2, to investigate an appropriate nutrient solution temperature (NST),O. pumilawas cultivated at four NSTs (10, 20, 26, and 35 degrees C, named as T10, T20, T26, and T36, respectively) for 35 DAT. The growth and CPT content at T20 was the highest among the treatments. Therefore, root-zone environments of 0.25 NSC and 20 degrees C of NST produced the best growth and CPT accumulation inO. pumila.

AB  - The COVID-19 emergency has revealed the extreme fragility of large cities to unexpected complex global risks and crises. City lockdown has led to increasing awareness of the vital importance of food availability for citizens. The combined effect of border closure and movement restrictions increased food losses and export costs, especially for vegetables and perishable goods exposing non-self-sufficient countries. We claim the idea that urban agriculture in developed countries should be fostered with emerging growing practices and edible green infrastructures, such as vertical farming, hydroponics, aeroponic, aquaponic, and rooftop greenhouses. Notwithstanding the limitations of traditional urban farming activities, innovative and disruptive solutions and short food supply chains of fresh agricultural products might play a positive role in lessening uncertainties from global systemic risks.

AB  - Sustainable development is of growing importance to the agriculture sector because the current lacking utilization of resources and energy usage, together with the pollution generated from toxic chemicals, cannot continue at present rates. Sustainability in agriculture can be achieved through using less (or no) poisonous chemicals, saving natural resources, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Technology applications could help farmers to use proper data in decision-making, which leads to low-input agriculture. This work focuses on the role of smart technology implementation in sustainable agriculture. The effects of smart technology implementation are analyzed by using a case study approach. The results show that the plant factory using intelligence technology enhances sustainability performance by increasing production productivity, product quality, crop per year, resource use efficiency, and food safety, as well as improving employees' quality of life.

AB  - Controlled environment (CE) food crop production has existed in the United States for many years, but recent improvements in technology and increasing production warranted a closer examination of the industry. Therefore, our objectives were to characterize historical trends in CE production, understand the current state of the U.S. hydroponics industry, and use historical and current trends to inform future perspectives. In the 1800s, CE food production emerged and increased in popularity until 1929. After 1929, when adjusted for inflation (AFI), CE food production stagnated and decreased until 1988. From 1988 to 2014, the wholesale value of CE food production increased from $64.2 million to $796.7 million AFI. With the recent increase in demand for locally grown food spurring an increase in CE production, both growers and researchers have been interested in using hydroponic CE technologies to improve production and quality. Therefore, we surveyed U.S. hydroponic food crop producers to identify current hydroponic production technology adoption and potential areas for research needs. Producers cited a wide range of technology utilization; more than half employed solely hydroponic production techniques, 56% monitored light intensity, and more than 80% monitored air temperature and nutrient solution pH and electrical conductivity. Additionally, the growing environments varied from greenhouses (64%), indoors in multilayer (31%) or single-layer (7%) facilities, to hoop houses or high tunnels (29%). Overall, producers reported managing the growing environment to improve crop flavor and the development of production strategies as the most beneficial research areas, with 90% stating their customers would pay more for crops with increased flavor. Lastly, taking historical data and current practices into account, perspectives on future hydroponic CE production are discussed. These include the importance of research on multiple environmental parameters instead of single parameters in isolation and the emphasis on not only increasing productivity but improving crop quality including flavor, sensory attributes, and postharvest longevity.

AB  - Advancements in availability and specificity of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have facilitated trait modification of high-value edible herbs and vegetables through the fine manipulation of spectra. Coriander (Coriandrum sativum L.) is a culinary herb, known for its fresh, citrusy aroma, and high economic value. Studies into the impact of light intensity and spectrum on C. sativum physiology, morphology, and aroma are limited. Using a nasal impact frequency panel, a selection of key compounds associated with the characteristic aroma of coriander was identified. Significant differences (P < 0.05) were observed in the concentration of these aromatics between plants grown in a controlled environment chamber under the same photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) but custom spectra: red (100%), blue (100%), red + blue (RB, 50% equal contribution), or red + green + blue (RGB, 35.8% red: 26.4% green: 37.8% blue) wavelengths. In general, the concentration of aromatics increased with increasing numbers of wavelengths emitted alongside selective changes, e.g., the greatest increase in coriander-defining E-(2)-decenal occurred under the RGB spectrum. This change in aroma profile was accompanied by significant differences (P < 0.05) in light saturated photosynthetic CO2 assimilation, water-use efficiency (W-i), and morphology. While plants grown under red wavelengths achieved the greatest leaf area, RB spectrum plants were shortest and had the highest leaf:shoot ratio. Therefore, this work evidences a trade-off between sellable commercial morphologies with a weaker, less desirable aroma or a less desirable morphology with more intense coriander-like aromas. When supplemental trichromatic LEDs were used in a commercial glasshouse, the majority of compounds, with the exception of linalool, also increased showing that even as a supplement additional wavelength can modify the aromatic profile increasing its complexity. Lower levels of linalool suggest these plants may be more susceptible to biotic stress such as herbivory. Finally, the concentration of coriander-defining aromatics E-(2)-decenal and E-(2)-hexenal was significantly higher in supermarket pre-packaged coriander leaves implying that concentrations of aromatics increase after excision. In summary, spectra can be used to co-manipulate aroma profile and plant form with increasing spectral complexity leading to greater aromatic complexity and intensity. We suggest that increasing spectral complexity progressively stimulates signaling pathways giving rise to valuable economic traits.

AB  - New, more innovative, better-focused and cost effective ways need to be developed in order to ascertain the sustainability of the global food system. This work introduced the research problem as if small scale urban Plant Factories with Automated Lighting (ssPFAL) are a viable investment option in order to promote food supply security in the ever expanding distributed energy generation environment. It is examined if and how wind energy microgeneration (small scale wind turbines) could grow hand-inhand with small-scale hydroponic systems providing an alternative income stream for the wind business owners and at the same time increase urban based vegetables production. The small scale wind industry could be developed further within cities if they operate as unified systems with ssPFAL. Tomato, basil, and lettuce were examined and it was proven that the latter were much more profitable under all scenarios. Tomato's Internal Rate of Return (IRR) was at all cases between 2.5 and 11.3%, while for basil and lettuce could even surpass 100%. The methodology governing the research process in order for an answer to be given to the research problem, will be presented in accordance to the energy, demand response, and energy demand in the rural and suburban environment.

AB  - Although plant responses to artificial lighting spectra often produce abnormal morphogenesis and reduced productivity, no quantification method to determine how plants perceive and respond to light has been available. Our objective in this study was to test whether a plant's spectral perception can be quantified using the light absorption of its major photoreceptors, phytochrome, cryptochrome, and phototropin. We developed an artificial solar lamp and three different light sources, based on a high-pressure sodium lamp, a fluorescent lamp, and red and blue light-emitting diodes, whose absorption by photoreceptors was equal to that of the standard solar spectrum. Cucumber plants grown under the artificial solar and developed light sources showed normal photomorphogenesis and were indistinguishable from each other. Plants grown under unmodified commercial light sources had abnormal photomorphogenesis that made them short and small. The photosynthetic rate was higher under the unmodified light sources; however, dry masses were highest under the artificial solar and modified light sources, indicating that the cucumber plants are optimized to the solar spectrum. Our results clearly demonstrate that the spectral perceptions of plants can be quantified using the light absorption of their photoreceptors, not visual color or spectra. We expect that our findings will contribute to a better understanding of plant perceptions of and responses to light quality, and improve the productivity of plants cultivated under artificial light.

AB  - Light, as the energy and signal sources for plant growth and development, is one of the most important environment factors in recently developed plant factories with artificial light (PFALs). To find the optimal combination of light wavelengths for lettuce (Lactuca sativa cv. 'Tiberius') plant growth in a PFAL, four treatments, each using red (R; 662 nm) and blue light (B; 447 nm) with a ratio of 4:1 and photon flux density (PFD) of 150 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1) , and mixing, respectively, with 50 mu mol.m(-2).S-1 of green light (G; 525 nm; RBG), yellow light (Y; 592 nm; RBY), orange light (O; 605 nm; RBO) and far-red light (FR; 742 nm; RBFR), were set up during this experiment. A combination of R and B with a ratio of 4:1 and PFD of 200 mu mol(-2).s(-1) was set as the control (RB). The responses of lettuce growth, morphology, anatomical structure of the lettuce leaf, photosynthetic performance, lettuce nutritional quality, and energy use efficiency were investigated. The results showed that RBG, RBO, and RBFR increased the shoot fresh weight of lettuce by 20.5%, 19.6%, and 40.4%, and they increased the shoot dry weight of lettuce by 24.2%, 13.4%, and 45.2%, respectively, compared with those under RB. The P-n under RBY was significantly lower than that under RB, although no significant differences in chlorophyll or carotenoid content were found between RBY and RB. RBG increased the lettuce leaf area, the thickness of the leaf palisade tissue, P-n, and light use efficiency compared with those under RB. Plants grown under RBO showed better photosynthetic capacity, such as higher P-n,P-Phi(PSII), and other photosynthetic parameters. RBFR caused an increase in lettuce leaf area and energy use efficiency, but a decrease in leaf thickness and P-n of the single leaf. Moreover, tipburn injury was observed under RBFR. Therefore, these results demonstrate that RBG and RBO can be considered optimal combinations of light wavelengths for lettuce growth in a PFAL in this experiment, although plant growth can also be improved by using RBFR.

AB  - Vertical farming is an emerging area of food production that aims to provide sustainable intensification of agriculture by maximising the obtainable yield per unit area of land. This approach commonly utilises stacked horizontal levels of crop growth in glasshouse or controlled environment (CE) facilities. Vertical farming has, however, received relatively little scientific investigation to date. Consequently, important factors such as economic feasibility, system design and optimisation of production methods are still being evaluated. Vertical farming methods bring additional considerations for the effective management of pests and diseases compared with conventional protected horticulture, such as movement of both pest and beneficial insects between growth levels. This article aims to provide a perspective on the positive and negative issues facing pest and disease control in Vertical farming systems. We highlight important considerations for system optimisation and areas for future investigation.

AB  - Plants respond to root temperature stresses by producing antioxidants as a defense mechanism. Since a number of these are phytochemicals with enhancing effects on human health, we examined the effects of 4 root-zone temperature (RZT) treatments (10, 20, 28, and 36 degrees C) on plant growth and the main bioactive compound concentrations in each organ of Agastache rugosa plants. We aimed to determine the optimal RZT treatment to increase bioactive compound concentrations with no deleterious effects on plant growth. Four-week-old seedlings were grown in a plant factory for 32 days. Nine plant growth parameters, namely, shoot and root fresh weights, stem and root lengths, leaf length and leaf width, leaf area, and shoot and root dry weights were significantly decreased at 10 and 36 degrees C compared with other treatments. A similar pattern was observed for the chlorophyll content and leaf gas exchange parameters. Of all the RZT treatments, RZT at 28 degrees C produced the significantly greatest accumulation of two major bioactive compounds, namely, rosmarinic acid (RA) and tilianin contents per the A. rugosa plant, and had no adverse effects on the overall growth of A. rugosa. This supports the use of 28 degrees C RZT to successfully improve the bioactive compounds with no adverse influence on plant growth or yield.

AB  - A solar illumination design with fluorescent coatings to change in crop growth in vertical farms was investigated using simulations based on numerical analysis. The fluorescent reflectors were used as part of the lighting system to improve the irradiation for photosynthesis over the shelves. The reflectors were based on optical glass (BK7) embedded with fluorescent pigments (K2SiF6:Mn4+) and were used in the light distribution system to increase crop production by improving spatial light distribution and altering the solar spectrum. The optimum number of shelves was identified for three different latitudes, considering a fixed size of solar collector. It was estimated that introducing fluorescent reflectors to the system could lead to an increase in crop production exceeding 35%. (C) 2020 IAgrE. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The effects of light factors affecting growth and quality of vegetables and fruits at mature stages have been often reported while for that of microgreens is still limited. This study was to determine the optimum light spectrum, light intensity and photoperiod that enhanced growth and nutritional values of amaranth microgreens by using light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Two amaranth cultivars, red amaranth and leafy vegetable amaranth, were cultured for 8 days under different light spectra, light intensities and photoperiods provided by LEDs. Three consecutive experiments in the split-plot design were conducted by which, for each experiment, light treatment was a main-plot factor and amaranth cultivar was a sub-plot factor. The first experiment, amaranth microgreens were irradiated by different light spectra: red, blue, red plus blue (70R:30B) and white with photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) of 130 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). The second experiment, the plants were illuminated under various light intensities: 130, 180, 230, 280 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) PPFD with red plus blue (70R:30B) spectrum. The third experiment, the microgreens were treated with different photoperiods: 8, 12, 16, 20h (h) under red plus blue (70R:30B) spectrum and 280 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) PPFD. The results indicated that red plus blue (70R:30B) spectrum, 280 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) PPFD and 16 h photoperiod enhanced the fresh yield, chlorophyll a, b, total carotenoids, anthocyanin, and vitamin C contents and total antioxidant capacity for both red amaranth and leafy vegetable amaranth microgreens. The cultivar differences in the responses to light spectra and photoperiods were found.

AB  - Light drives photosynthesis and regulates plant morphology, physiology, and phytochemical content. Using light emitting diodes (LEDs), customized spectra can be created, including spectrum that simulates solar light. The aim of this study was to assess the growth, development, and phytochemical content at three marketable stages of lettuce (transplant, baby-leaf, and head-lettuce) under a sun-simulated spectrum and common light spectra used in indoor growing systems. Oakleaf red (Salanova (R) 'Red Oakleaf) and green (Salanova (R) 'Green Oakleaf) lettuce were grown under seven spectra. A sun-simulated light treatment (SUN) was created with 5% ultraviolet-A (UV-A), 20 % blue (B), 26 % green (G), 26 % red (R), and 23 % far-red (FR) light as percent photon flux density (PFD). In addition, five treatments of differing blue:red (B:R) ratios were evaluated: OB:100R (100R), 20B:80R, 50B:50R, 80B:20R, and 100B:OR (100B) and fluorescent white light was used as a control (6500 K). Plants were provided with 200 +/- 0.7 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1) biologically active radiation (300-800 nm) for 18 h and grown at 20.0 +/- 0.2 'C temperature. Fresh mass of lettuce in the SUN treatment was not significantly different when compared to B:R light treatments in all harvest dates despite the 36 % greater photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) in B:R treatments. Plant dry mass on day 17 of' Green Oakleaf and 'Red Oakleaf grown under 20B:80R was 15-39 % greater than those grown in 100B and SUN. When calculating total dry mass accumulation to cumulative yield photon flux density (YPFD), plants in SUN treatment accumulated the same dry mass per YPFD input (mg mol(-1)). Leaf area at day 42 of plants in 100B, SUN, and FL was 39-78 % greater than plants in B:R treatments. At final harvest (day 42), plant stem length in SUN was 2.1-4.4 times longer than in all other treatments, indicating bolting and flowering initiation. Both total phenolic and anthocyanin concentrations were greater in the B:R treatments than in SUN, 100R, and 100B treatments. This study presents baseline information for lettuce responses under LED-simulated SUN spectrum when compared to common B:R treatments and offers insights on lettuce growth and morphology under different spectra at multiple growth stages.

AB  - In recent years, several global issues related to food waste, increasing CO2 emissions, water pollution, over-fertilization, deforestation, loss of arable land, food security, and energy storage have emerged. Climate change urgently needs to be addressed from an ecological and social perspective. Implementing new indoor urban vertical farming (IUVF) operations is one way to combat the above-mentioned issues as well as foodborne illnesses, scarcity of drinking water, and more crop failure due to infection from plant pathogens and insect pests. A promising production mode is plant factories (PFs), which are indoor plant production systems completely isolated from outside environment. This paper mainly focuses on the comprehensive review of scientific papers in order to analyse the different applications of urban farming (UF) based on three different dimensions: a) the manufacturing techniques and equipment used; b) the energy that these systems require, the distribution of energy, and ways to minimize the energy-related cost; and c) the technological innovations applied in order to optimize the cultivation possibilities of IUVF.

AB  - Artificial LED source provides the possibility to regulate the lighting environment in plant factorys that use limited space to plant, aiming at high throughput and good quality. However, different parameters of light intensity, quality, and photoperiod will influence the growth and accumulation of bio-compounds in plants. In order to find the optimal setting of LED light for spinach planting, four group experiments were designed using the orthogonal testing method. According to the experimental results, for growth indexes including fresh weight, dry weight, root length and so on, photoperiod is the most influential factor, light intensity is the second, and light quality is the least. The best light mode (R:B = 4:1, photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) = 100 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1) and 13/11 h) among all eight possible combinations in the range was also determined. Furthermore, for quality indexes, including the soluble sugar content, protein content and so on, a new scoring method was introduced to make a comprehensive score for evaluating. Then, the light combination (R:B = 4:1, PPFD = 150 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1) and 9/15 h) in the range was found as the optimal scheme for spinach quality under those parameters. As there is trade-off between the optimal light parameters for growth and quality, it is necessary to achieve a balance between yield and quality of the plant during production. If farmers want to harvest spinach with larger leaf area and higher yield, they need to pay attention to the adjustment of the photoperiod and use a lower light intensity and a longer lighting time. If they do not mind the yield of the vegetable but want to improve the taste and nutrition of spinach products, they should pay more attention to the light intensity and use a higher light intensity and a shorter lighting time.

AB  - As one of the key elements of indoor agriculture, horticultural light sources are developing rapidly towards requiring high energy density, high output power and high stability, which poses a challenge for traditional phosphor conversion devices. To address this, an all-inorganic blue-red dual-emitting light convertor consisting of Ba1.3Sr1.7MgSi2O8:Eu2+,Mn2+ (BSMS) phosphor-in-glass (PiG) plates was prepared to improve the duration lifetime of converted high-power light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and meet the light quality requirements of photosynthesis for indoor agriculture. The obtained samples show an external quantum efficiency of 45.3%, outstanding thermal stability and a specific emission spectrum that highly matches the absorption of chlorophyll and beta-carotene. Moreover, a proof-of-concept BSMS-PiG horticultural lamp for application in an indoor plant factory was successfully fabricated based on a similar to 370 nm emitting LED chip. The blue-red ratio of its spectrum could be regulated by controlling the thickness of BSMS-PiG and the concentrations of Mn2+ ions within BSMS-PiG. The BSMS-PiG horticultural LEDs were applied to the indoor cultivation of Romaine lettuce. The results indicated that the biomass of Romaine lettuce was 58.21% greater than that of control lettuce samples cultivated under commercial plant lamps. In particular, the content values of total chlorophyll, beta-carotene and soluble protein were improved. The BSMS-PiG horticultural LED is a potential candidate to act as a high-power horticultural light source.

AB  - The increase in global food demand has led to the introduction of new food production systems. One key example is the plant factory. Plant factories face the same challenge as many high-tech building functions: high energy demands resulting from high internal heat loads. In this study we investigate how this energy demand can be reduced through facade design. Energy efficient design closely follows function, facade construction and local climate. Therefore, we analysed the effects of facade properties on the energy use in plant factories for three disparate climate zones: Sweden (Dfc), the Netherlands (Cfb) and the United Arab Emirates (BWh). We coupled the building energy simulation program EnergyPlus with a crop transpiration model to calculate the lighting, sensible cooling, latent cooling, and heating demand from the energy balance. In terms of energy demand (kWh m(-2)), opaque facades with high U-values and optimised albedo can reduce the facilities' cooling demand by 18.8%, 30.0% and 30.4%, and their energy demand by 6.1%, 12.5% and 9.5%, for the United Arab Emirates, the Netherlands and Sweden, respectively. In terms of electricity use (kWhe m(-2)), transparent facades are more efficient, as they allow the use of freely available solar energy instead of artificial light. These facades can reduce electricity use by 9.4%, 7.6% and 7.4%, for the United Arab Emirates, the Netherlands and Sweden, respectively. The presented facade design strategies can significantly reduce energy demand in plant factories. The investigation provides a foundation for the energy efficient design of high-tech buildings, tailored to local climate.

AB  - In recent years, a new urban environment in the large metropolitan areas, the so-called "megacities", has emerged. It is estimated that more than five billion people will be located in urban areas by 2030. Many projects have been initiated in the megacities to support the new ecosystem services in providing the most sustainable and efficient food supply solutions, as well as for transporting fresh and clean vegetables. One of the most important focus areas is research on energy sustainability, including how to optimize energy efficiency to meet the needs of citizens and companies. Indoor urban vertical farming (IUVF) is one of the greatest achievements of our time in agriculture, as it is entirely focused on meeting the food needs of people living in urban areas with the lowest environmental and energy costs. IUVF creates a new foundation in the urban food production system, providing opportunities for many other sustainable activities, such as energy and grey water recycling, but beyond all, it helps citizens to have access in fresh and nutritious fruits and vegetables and to become more creative building up their skills regarding sustainable food production. In this study, the internal rate of return (IRR) and the net present value (NPV) indexes were used to compare IUVF and greenhouse (GH) facilities under various financing schemes. Consistent with similar studies, this research also confirms that IUVF is much more profitable for investors, saving significant resources compared to GHs.

AB  - Agriculture 4.0 is comprised of different already operational or developing technologies such as robotics, nanotechnology, synthetic protein, cellular agriculture, gene editing technology, artificial intelligence, blockchain, and machine learning, which may have pervasive effects on future agriculture and food systems and major transformative potential. These technologies underpin concepts such as vertical farming and food systems, digital agriculture, bioeconomy, circular agriculture, and aquaponics. In this perspective paper, we argue that more attention is needed for the inclusion and exclusion effects of Agriculture 4.0 technologies, and for reflection on how they relate to diverse transition pathways towards sustainable agricultural and food systems driven by mission-oriented innovation systems. This would require processes of responsible innovation, anticipating the potential impacts of Agriculture 4.0 through inclusive processes, and reflecting on and being responsive to emerging effects and where needed adjusting the direction and course of transition pathways.

AB  - The demand for high-nutrient and fresh vegetables, including coriander, has been growing rapidly. A plant factory with artificial lighting enables the application or suppression of stress conditions to plants for producing high-quality vegetables. This study aimed to determine a suitable root-zone temperature (RZT) treatment for enhancing the biomass and secondary metabolite content of hydroponic coriander plants. The combination of a mid-RZT (25 degrees C) pre-treatment with low (15 degrees C or 20 degrees C) or high (30 degrees C or 35 degrees C) RZT for a short period (3 or 6 days) was applied to the plants before harvesting. The fresh weights of the coriander plants were reduced under RZT stress. By contrast, the content of secondary metabolites, including ascorbic acid, carotenoids, phenolic compounds, chlorogenic acid, and the antioxidant capacity of the plants were enhanced by the combination of the lowest or highest RZT (15 degrees C or 35 degrees C) and the longer stress period (6 days). Growing coriander under an RZT of 30 degrees C for 6 days can produce large amounts of bioactive compounds and water, whereas growing coriander at an RZT of 15 degrees C for 6 days can produce high dry biomass and secondary metabolite content.

AB  - The effects of substrate water content on the growth and content of bioactive compounds in Crepidiastrum denticulatum were evaluated. Three-week-old seedlings were subjected to four levels of substrate water content (20%, 30%, 45% and 60%) and maintained for 5 weeks. Growth parameters at 5 weeks of transplanting were significantly higher with the 45% substrate water content treatment than with the other treatments. In addition, photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance and transpiration rate increased significantly and the highest sap flow rate during the day was observed in 45% substrate water content. Total phenolic content and antioxidant capacity per shoot increased significantly with substrate water content, increasing from 20% to 45% and decreased again at 60%. Antioxidant capacity and total hydroxycinnamic acids (HCAs) content per unit dry weight of plants under the 60% treatment were significantly higher than those under the 45% treatment; however, their content per shoot was the highest under the 45% treatment. Thus, 45% substrate water content is a suitable condition for the growth of C. denticulatum and had positive effects on phenolic content, antioxidant capacity, and HCAs content. These results could be useful for the mass production of high-quality C. denticulatum in greenhouses or plant factories capable of controlling the water content of the root zone.

AB  - Crepidiastrum denticulatum (Korean common name: i-go-deul-ppae-gi) is a valuable medicinal plant used in the pharmaceutical industry and as a raw material of functional foods. In this study, we investigated the effect of light quality on C. denticulatum growth, with the goal of improving the species' biomass and bioactive compound content when grown in plant factories with artificial lighting. Three-week-old seedlings were grown for 6 weeks in a plant factory under fluorescent lamps (control) and various sets of light-emitting diodes (LEDs): three monochromatic [red (R), green (G), and blue (B)], several dichromatic RB with different ratios of R and B [R:B = 6:4 (R6B4), 7:3 (R7B3), 8:2 (R8B2), and 9:1 (R9B1)], and several trichromatic RGB [R:G:B = 5:1:4 (R5G1B4), 6:1:3 (R6G1B3), 7:1:2 (R7G1B2), 8:1:1 (R8G1B1), and 9:1:0 (R9G1B0)]. Shoot biomass (fresh weight), leaf area, leaf shape index, and water content of the shoot were significantly higher in the RGB group than in the monochromatic and RB groups. Increasing the percentage of R light improved shoot growth in the presence of G light, as in the RGB group, and this was accompanied by a high photosynthetic rate, light absorbance rate, and electron transport rate. The contents of total phenolics and hydroxycinnamic acids per unit dry weight did not differ between plants subjected to the different light quality treatments, and the contents per shoot were thus positively associated with shoot biomass. Overall, R8G1B1 was the most effective treatment for increasing shoot biomass and the accumulation of bioactive compounds; the shoot fresh weight and total hydroxycinnamic content of R8G1B1 were significantly higher, by 50 % and 60 %, respectively, than those of the control. Thus, light quality affects the biosynthesis of bioactive compounds and the shoot biomass of C. denticulatum.

AB  - Red plus blue light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are commonly applied in plant factories with artificial lighting due to photosynthetic pigments, which absorb strongly in red and blue light regions of the spectrum. However, plants grown under natural environment are used to utilizing broad-wide spectrum by long-term evolution. In order to examine the effects of addition light added in red plus blue LEDs or white LEDs, green and purple leaf lettuces (Lactuca sativa L. cv. Lvdie and Ziya) were hydroponically cultivated for 20 days under white LEDs, white plus red LEDs, red plus blue LEDs, and red plus blue LEDs supplemented with ultraviolet, green or far-red light, respectively. The results indicated that the addition of far-red light in red plus blue LEDs increased leaf fresh and dry weights of green leaf lettuce by 28% and 34%, respectively. Addition of ultraviolet light did not induce any differences in growth and energy use efficiency in both lettuce cultivars, while supplementing green light with red plus blue LEDs reduced the vitamin C content of green leaf lettuce by 44% and anthocyanin content of purple leaf lettuce by 30% compared with red plus blue LEDs, respectively. Spectral absorbencies of purple leaf lettuce grown under red plus blue LEDs supplemented with green light were lower in green light region compared with those grown under red plus blue LEDs, which was associated with anthocyanin contents. White plus red LEDs significantly increased leaf fresh and dry weights of purple leaf lettuce by 25%, and no significant differences were observed in vitamin C and nitrate contents compared with white LEDs. Fresh weight, light and electrical energy use efficiencies of hydroponic green and purple leaf lettuces grown under white plus red LEDs were higher or no significant differences compared with those grown under red plus blue LEDs. In conclusion, white plus red LEDs were suggested to substitute for red plus blue LEDs in hydroponic lettuce (cv. Lvdie and Ziya) production in plant factories with artificial lighting.

AB  - Among abiotic stresses, both drought and UV-B radiation effectively trigger the accumulation of secondary metabolites, and can be widely applied in plant factories. The objectives of this study were to investigate antioxidant accumulation under drought stress alone, or in combination with UV-B radiation near harvest, and to determine an optimal treatment time for maximum antioxidant production. Kale (Brassica oleracea L. var. acephala) plants were grown in a plant factory and harvested at 42 days after transplanting. The single and combination treatments lasted for 7 to 1 days and 4 to 2 days before harvest, respectively. The results of both F-v/F-m (maximal photochemical efficiency in photosystem II) and leaf water potential could ensure the function of photosynthesis and maintain normal leaf moisture in single drought treatments of less than 4 days. The total phenolic and flavonoid contents and antioxidant activities were significantly increased in both single and combination treatments for 3 to 4 days, compared to other treatments. The supplementary UV-B treatments showed no extra formation of antioxidants compared to the single drought treatments. As a result, drought for 3 days before harvest could achieve the highest potential value of kale as a source of natural antioxidants.

AB  - Light and nutrient are important factors for vegetable production in plant factory or greenhouse. The total 12 treatments which contained the combination of four light intensity (150, 250, 350 and 450 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1)) and three nutrient solution concentration (NSC) (1/4, 1/2, 3/4 strength NSC) were established for investigation of lettuce growth and quality in a growth chamber. The combination of light intensity and NSC exhibited significant effects on photosynthetic pigment, nutritional quality, mineral content and antioxidant capacity. That a higher light intensity were readily accessible to higher chlorophyll a/b showed in lettuce of treatment of 350 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1)x3/4NSC and 450 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1)x1/4NSC. Lower total N contents, higher content of soluble protein, vitamin C, soluble sugar and free amino acid exhibited in lettuce under treatment of 250 and 350 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1)x1/4NSC or 3/4NSC. With increasing NSC and LED irradiance, the content of total P and K in lettuce increased and decreased, respectively. The highest and lowest total Ca content were found in treatment of 150 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1)x1/4NSC and 450 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1)x1/4NSC, respectively, and higher content of total Mg and Zn was observed under 250 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)x1/4NSC and 150 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1)x3/4NSC, respectively. The antioxidant contents generally decreased with increasing NSC level. The higher antioxidant content and capacity occurred in lettuce of 350 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1)x1/4NSC treatment. The interaction of 350 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1)x1/4NSC might be the optimal condition for lettuce growth in plant factory.

AB  - Vertical farming using light-emitting diode offers potential for the early production phase (few weeks) of young ornamental plants. However, once transferred to the greenhouse, the photosynthetic acclimation of these young plants might depend on this initial light regime. To obtain insight about this acclimatization, Chrysanthemum (sun species) and Spathiphyllum (shade species) were preconditioned in growth chambers for 4 weeks under four light qualities: blue (B), red (R), red/blue (RB, 60% R) and white (W) at 100 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). Monochromatic light (R and B) limited leaf development of both species, which resulted in a lower leaf mass per area when compared to multispectral light (RB for Chrysanthemum, RB and W for Spathiphyllum). R-developed leaves had a lower photosynthetic efficiency in both species. After the light quality pretreatment, plants were transferred to the greenhouse with high-intensity natural light conditions. On the first day of transfer, R and B preconditioned leaves of both species had an inhibited photosynthesis. After 1 week in natural light condition, rapid light curve parameters of Chrysanthemum leaves that developed under B acclimated to sunlight had a similar level than RB-developed leaves unlike R-leaves. Spathiphyllum leaves showed a decrease in maximum electron transport rate and this was most pronounced for the R pretreatment. After 1 month, R-preconditioned Chrysanthemum had the lowest dry mass, while no effects on the dry weight of Spathiphyllum with respect to the pretreatments were observed. Light quality during preconditioning affected the leaf ability to acclimate to natural high light intensities in greenhouse environment.

AB  - A multi-fan system (MFS) for single culture beds was developed to improve the airflow in a plant factory with artificial light. The MFS had seven fans which were installed on both the front and back sides of culture beds to generate airflow from two opposite horizontal directions. The fans that push the air into the culture bed were air inlets while those that pull the air out of the culture bed were air outlets. In this study, three airflow patterns were evaluated: T-1, the front and back sides of the culture bed were air inlets; T-2, the front side was an air inlet and the backside was an air outlet; and T-3, both the front and back sides were air outlets. A culture bed with no MFS was used as a control (T-4). Lettuce growth and tipburn occurrence were evaluated and leaf boundary layer resistance (1/g(bv)), sensible heat flux (S-h), and latent heat flux (L-h) of lettuce plants were estimated. The airflow pattern in T-1 improved the air velocity (V-a) by an average of 0.75 m s(-1) and a variation coefficient of 65%. The 1/g(bv), decreased significantly with the increase in V-a, and the lowest value of 54.0 s m(-1) was observed in T-1. The low resistance to heat and moisture transfer enhanced the Sh and Lh of lettuce plants. The average S-h and L-h were 40% and 46% higher in T-1 compared with those in T-4. The fresh and dry weights of lettuce plants in T-1 were 1.13 and 1.06 higher than those in T-4, respectively. No tipburn occurrence was observed in lettuce plants grown under the MFS while five leaves per plant were injured with tipburn in T-4. The results indicated that improving the airflow can improve the growth of indoor cultured lettuce and alleviate the occurrence of tipburn due to the decrease in the 1/g(bv) and the increase in the transpiration rate.

AB  - Plant production in urban areas is receiving much attention due to its potential role in feeding the rapidly growing population of city dwellers. However, higher energy demands in urban plant factories are among the key challenges that need to be addressed. Artificial lighting is responsible for the most significant levels of energy consumption in plant factories; therefore, lighting systems must be modulated in consideration of the sustainable food-energy nexus. In this context, low light irradiation using blue (B) and red (R) LED was applied in a plant factory for the growth of red leaf lettuce (Lactuca sativa L. var Lollo rosso) to evaluate the growth performance and functional quality. The tested B (450 nm) and R (660 nm) light ratios were B/R = 5:1; 3:1; 1:1; 1:3, and 1:5, with a photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) of 90 +/- 3 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). In the plant factory, the photoperiod, temperature, RH, and CO2 conditions were 16 h d(-1), 20 +/- 0.5 degrees C, 65% +/- 5%, and 360 +/- 10 mu L L-1, respectively. The lettuce was harvested 10 and 20 days after the commencement of LED light treatment (DAT). In this study, normal photosynthetic activity and good visual quality of the lettuce were observed. The results show that a higher fraction of R (B/R = 1:5) significantly increased plant growth parameters such as plant height, leaf area, specific leaf area, plant fresh and dry weight, and carbohydrate content. By contrast, a higher fraction of B (B/R = 5:1) significantly increased the photosynthetic parameters and contents of pigment and phenolic compounds. The rate of photosynthetic performance, carbohydrates (except starch), and content of phenolic compounds were highest after 10 DAT, whereas the pigment contents did not significantly differ at the different growth stages. It is concluded that high R fractions favor plant growth and carbohydrate content, while high B fractions favor photosynthetic performance and the accumulation of pigments and phenolic compounds in red leaf lettuce under limited lighting conditions. This study will help in designing artificial lighting conditions for plant factory production to reduce energy demands.

AB  - Cities are increasingly turning into megacities due to their enlarged and intense population. There has been a global attempt by designers to spread the view that cities can be potential areas for producing loads of food required by communities and fitted for specific ecologies. A similar trend has been spread to developing countries where it is essential to provide food for local consumption, and serious attempts are made to distribute food materials to protect particular urban communities. Therefore, recent attempts of food security have aimed not only to guarantee availability but also the provision of sustainable, locally-fitted and food production that is not industrialized to sustain the potential for production. The solution seems to be Vertical Farming (VF). Producing food can be brought into cities through VF and this significant step, if taken, can make life in cities more viable. The present research aims to review the VF plays in the future of food production in high-density cities.

AB  - Strawberry plants are grown in hydroponics for higher quality and yield, as this system excludes soil-borne disease issues. Recycled hydroponics is practiced to make cultivation cost-effective, sustainable, and environmentally friendly. However, due to recycling of hydroponic nutrient solution, plant root exudates accumulate, leading to autotoxicity, a form of allelopathy that inhibits growth and development. In recent decades, commercial cultivation of strawberry under greenhouse and plant factory conditions following recycled hydroponics has been widely adopted globally. Subsequently, yield decline has also been reported due to development of autotoxicity from the accumulated root exudates. In recycled hydroponic systems, strawberry plant growth is inhibited by root exudates that contain mainly phenolic acids in the culture solution. In this regard, elimination of these accumulated root exudates or allelochemicals from the culture solution would restore inhibited plant growth and yield. A number of research studies have been conducted on autotoxicity in strawberry and possible mitigation methods. These studies suggested that addition of activated charcoal in the nutrient solution, supplementation of auxin on leaves, electro-degradation of root exudates in nutrient solution, and supplementation of amino acids and/or LEDs can effectively remove/degrade/mitigate autotoxicity in strawberry grown under recycling hydroponics. This review mainly discusses the autotoxicity phenomenon in strawberry under recycled hydroponics, the responsible allelochemicals and their mechanism of action, mitigation methods and future research endeavors in this field.

AB  - External electrode fluorescent lamps (EEFLs) are a new, efficient light source that can be used in plant factories. We examined the effects of light intensity and photoperiod combinations on growth, total phenolic content, antioxidant capacity, and light use efficiency of lettuce (Lactuca sativa 'Cheongchima') in a plant factory employing EEFLs. Two-week-old seedlings were grown for 3 weeks at a photosynthetic photon flux density of 150 (150P) or 200 (200P) mu mol.m(-2).s(-1) under 12, 16, 20, or 24 h photoperiods. The air temperature was maintained at 20 +/- 2 degrees C and Yamazaki nutrient solution was supplied using a deep flow technique. Fresh shoot and root weights increased as photoperiod was extended, becoming greatest under the 150P/24 h condition. The shoot/root ratio was lowest at the 24 h photoperiod under 150P and 200P conditions. Leaf length decreased at longer photoperiods, but leaf width and number was increased; therefore, leaf shape became broader under longer photoperiods. Leaf area increased at the 150P/20 h condition but decreased at the 200P/24 h condition. Specific leaf weight (thickness) increased significantly as photoperiod was extended irrespective of light intensity and became greater under 200P than 150P. Total phenolic content and antioxidant capacity increased continuously with increasing photoperiods under 150P; however, in the 200P treatment, both increased up to 20 h, then decreased under the 24 h photoperiod. Light use efficiency was generally higher under 150P, but became similar at either light intensity under the 24 h period. Considering the growth rate, leaf size, antioxidant capacity, and cropping cycle, the 150P/20 h condition was deemed to be the most efficient and economical for growth of 'Cheongchima' lettuce in a plant factory system.

AB  - This paper presents the development process of a digital twin of a unique hydroponic underground farm in London, Growing Underground (GU). Growing 12x more per unit area than traditional greenhouse farming in the UK, the farm also consumes 4x more energy per unit area. Key to the ongoing operational success of this farm and similar enterprises is finding ways to minimize the energy use while maximizing crop growth by maintaining optimal growing conditions. As such, it belongs to the class of Controlled Environment Agriculture, where indoor environments are carefully controlled to maximize crop growth by using artificial lighting and smart heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems. We tracked changing environmental conditions and crop growth across 89 different variables, through a wireless sensor network and unstructured manual records, and combined all the data into a database. We show how the digital twin can provide enhanced outputs for a bespoke site like GU, by creating inferred data fields, and show the limitations of data collection in a commercial environment. For example, we find that lighting is the dominant environmental factor for temperature and thus crop growth in this farm, and that the effects of external temperature and ventilation are confounded. We combine information learned from historical data interpretation to create a bespoke temperature forecasting model (root mean squared error < 1.3 degrees C), using a dynamic linear model with a data-centric lighting component. Finally, we present how the forecasting model can be integrated into the digital twin to provide feedback to the farmers for decision-making assistance.

AB  - High plant number per unit area makes it challenging to monitor plant growth in controlled environment agriculture (CEA) systems. Our objective was to develop and validate image analysis technique that uses a smartphone connected to local desktop computer for non-destructive measurement of growth characteristics of several species commonly grown in CEA. Using mobile apps, an iPhone-6 was remotely connected to a local computer containing image-processing software (MATLAB) and script. Smartphone was used to capture images of plants belonging to several species including basil, leaf lettuce, tomato, and zinnia. The images were moved to a folder on cloud storage and remotely processed on a local computer to derive estimated leaf area (LA(estimated)) of plants. Regression analysis indicated a near perfect linear relation between measured leaf area (LA(estimated)) and LA(estimated) (r(2) = 0.98) and shoot dry weight (SDW) and LA(estimated) (r(2) = 0.94) when data were pooled from all species. No significant differences were observed when relative growth rate (RGR) was measured using either SDW or LA(estimated) values. Further, results indicated that real-time and non-invasive LA(estimated) measurements can be used to track plant growth differences over time. This method was able to identify plant growth differences more accurately than visual assessments on plants. Our findings indicate that LA(estimated) can be used for accurate and non-invasive measurement of growth characteristics of plants in academic research. The technique can also aid in maximizing productivity, minimizing resource wastage and harvesting crops timely in commercial production.

AB  - Over the last several decades, plants have been developed as a platform for the production of useful recombinant proteins due to a number of advantages, including rapid production and scalability, the ability to produce unique glycoforms, and the intrinsic safety of food crops. The expression methods used to produce target proteins are divided into stable and transient systems depending on applications that use whole plants or minimally processed forms. In the early stages of research, stable expression systems were mostly used; however, in recent years, transient expression systems have been preferred. The production of the plant itself, which produces recombinant proteins, is currently divided into two major approaches, open-field cultivation and closed-indoor systems. The latter encompasses such regimes as greenhouses, vertical farming units, cell bioreactors, and hydroponic systems. Various aspects of each system will be discussed in this review, which focuses mainly on practical examples and commercially feasible approaches.

AB  - This article explores the use of raytracing software and heat load models to optimise the growing of crops vertically and by doing so, serves to increase the plausibility of urban Vertical Farms (VFs). Crop trays are modelled using a computer aided design (CAD) software and is then imported into a raytracing software TracePro-2019. Parameters obtained from the heat load and angle calculations would be used to start the simulation. Thereafter, solar irradiance obtained would be compared to different simulations with different design parameters. For this paper, the main design variable would be the tray width and tray inclination angle. After multiple simulations, it was found that trays at the bottom are less affected by varying angles of sunlight while trays at the top receive extreme variations. It was also noted that while the shaded area increases as tray inclination increases, the solar irradiance flux on each tray increases as opposed to decreasing. This new finding led to the conclusion that an increase in the angle of attack of the solar irradiance increased the occurrence of reflected and diffused irradiance. By just tilting the trays by 20, it allows more light to reach inwards, which would allow for a longer width of the trays. This in turn also increases the total yield of a tray in a limited space. This discovery can be utilised for the layout and arrangement for indoor VFs that relies on external solar irradiance for a light source and is proof that crop yield can be increased without adding extra energy consumption.
   Highlights
   Food engineering education in solar based VF system.
   Discuss challenges faced in modern land-scarce urban agriculture farms.
   TracePro 2019 for raytracing used in conjunction with ASHRAE sunlight modelling method.
   Tray width to height ratio is highly dependent on, to maximise crop yield while retaining amount of sunlight received for indoor vertical farming.
   Tilting of crop trays towards the sunlight is the most cost effective and energy saving way to maximise solar flux and space usage.
   External direct solar irradiance flux on crop trays decreases as tray inclination angles increases, but overall solar irradiance increases as steeper angles results in increased reflected solar irradiance.
   Capturing of reflected and diffused irradiance should be prioritised rather than maximising direct irradiance.

AB  - Research and practice during the last 20 years has shown that urban agriculture can contribute to minimising the effects of climate change by, at the same time, improving quality of life in urban areas. In order to do so most effectively, land use and spatial planning are crucial so as to obtain and maintain a supportive green infrastructure and to secure citizens' healthy living conditions. As people today trend more towards living in green and sustainable city centres that can offer fresh and locally produced food, cities become again places for growing food. The scope of urban agriculture thereby is to establish food production sites within the city's sphere; for example, through building-integrated agriculture including concepts such as aquaponics, indoor agriculture, vertical farming, rooftop production, edible walls, as well as through urban farms, edible landscapes, school gardens and community gardens. Embedded in changing urban food systems, the contribution of urban agriculture to creating sustainable and climate-friendly cities is pivotal as it has the capacity to integrate other resource streams such as water, waste and energy. This article describes some of the current aspects of the circular city debate where urban agriculture is pushing forward the development of material and resource cycling in cities.

AB  - This study investigated the growth characteristics and glucosinolate (GSL) levels of Chinese kale (Brassica oleracea var. alboglabra Bailey 'Jellujon') cultured within a plant factory using different concentrations of ammonium sulfate [(NH4)(2)SO4] and four different light-emitting diode (LED) combinations. In total, 16 combinations of the four (NH4)(2)SO4 concentrations and four LED light sources exerted significantly different effects on plant width, plant height, leaf length, leaf thickness, chlorophyll content, and the number of leaves. For the ratio combination of LED colors using blue light (B), red light (R), and white right (W), B0:R5:W5 showed the best growth characteristics, except for chlorophyll content. The leaf fresh weight (LFW) of Chinese kale did not change significantly with LED treatments, but varied significantly with (NH4)(2)SO4 treatments. S2 and S3 treatments among the (NH4)(2)SO4 treatments resulted in the largest increases in LFW under B0:R5:W5. Six major GSLs were identified, including as sinigrin (SIN), glucobrassicin, gluconapin, 4-OH glucobrassicin, 4-methoxy glucobrasscin, and neoglucobrasscin. The highest total GSL content was achieved with the combination of B0:R5 :W5 and S4, but no significant difference was found among the (NH4)(2)SO4 treatments. For LEDs, B0:R5 :W5 produced the highest total GSL levels. SIN was the dominant GSL under the combination of B0:R5 :W5 and S4. In conclusion, the combination of S4 and B0:R5 :W5 was the most suitable for increasing total GSLs and SIN.

AB  - This study was conducted to determine the most suitable light-emitting diodes (LEDs) for enhancing the growth characteristics, polyphenolic compounds, and essential oils in sweet basil (Ocimum basilicum L.) cultured in a plant factory. There were four LED combinations using three colors [Blue (B):Red (R):White (W) ratio = 0:1:9, 0:1:12, 0:5:5, and 2:3:5). The environmental conditions in the plant factory were maintained at 22.5 +/- 2.5 degrees C and 80 +/- 5% relative humidity. Sweet basil plants were grown in the plant factory at 3 weeks after sowing. The four combinations of LED light sources exerted a significant effect on total fresh weight (FW), shoot FW, and root FW but no effect on plant height and number of leaves. The B0:R5:W5 treatment resulted in the largest increases in both total FW and shoot FW. Both plant height and number of leaves did not change significantly with LED treatments but showed the best average growth using B0:R5:W5. The three major polyphenols were identified as rosmarinic acid, chicoric acid, and caffeic acid. Rosmarinic acid content accounted for the highest percentage of the polyphenols and was followed by chicoric and caffeic acids. The highest contents of rosmarinic and chicoric acids were achieved with B2:R3 :W5, but no significant difference in caffeic acid was found among the four LED conditions. Furthermore, B2 :R3 :W5 resulted in the highest yield of essential oil extracted from 50 g freeze-dried leaves of sweet basil, followed by B0:R5:W5, B0:R1:R12, and B0:R1:W9. Methyl-cinnamate content accounted for the highest percentage of the essential oils, followed by linalool, estragole, and eugenol, regardless of the LEDs. In conclusion, the B2:R3 :W5 light treatment was the most suitable one for increasing polyphenols and the yield of essential oils in sweet basil.

AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the proper electrical conductivity (EC) of a nutrient solution (NS) for accumulating bioactive compounds of Agastache rugosa without decreasing plant growth. Six-week-old seedlings were transplanted in a deep flow technique system with Hoagland NS with a 2.0 dS.m(-1) EC for the initial week. From eight days after transplanting, the plants were treated with six EC treatments of 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 6.0, and 8.0 dS.m(-1) for three weeks. Plant growth parameters, leaf gas exchange parameters, the relative chlorophyll value, and the ratio of variable to maximum fluorescence (F-v/F-m) were measured, and the rosmarinic acid (RA), tilianin, and acacetin concentrations were analyzed at 28 days after transplanting. The results showed that almost all plant growth parameters were maximized at 2.0 and 4.0 dS.m(-1) and minimized at 8.0 dS.m(-1) compared with the other EC treatments. The relative chlorophyll and F-v/F-m values were maximized at 2.0 and 4.0 dS.m(-1). Similarly, leaf gas exchange parameters were increased at 2.0 and 4.0 dS.m(-1). The RA content exhibited significantly higher values at 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 dS.m(-1) compared with other treatments. The tilianin and acacetin contents exhibited the significantly highest values at 4.0 and 0.5 dS.m (-1), respectively. These results suggest optimal EC treatment at 4.0 dS.m(-1) for increasing bioactive compounds in A. rugosa plants without decreasing plant growth. Excessively high or low EC induced salinity stress or nutrient deficiency, respectively. Furthermore, among the plant organs, the roots of A. rugosa contained the highest RA concentration and the flowers contained the highest tilianin and acacetin concentrations, which revealed a higher utilization potential of the roots and flowers for bioactive compounds.

AB  - Bletilla sfriata (Thunb.) Rchb. f. is a famous understory shade-obligated species with significant values as a source of herb medicine. Dry mass production is the main purpose that most cultural projects of B. striata cultivars purchase, but the current cultivation regime of B. striata is hard to advance its biomass accumulation. Therefore, this study was conducted to test the spectral effect on growth and dry mass in B. striata seedlings and further detect the physiological and biochemical responses accordingly as explanation for the mechanism. In a semi-plant factory condition, B. striata seedlings were cultured under three spectra with average photosynthetic photon flux rate of 74 lamol ill(-2) s(-1) given by light-emitting diodes (LEDs): R1BG5, 13.9% red, 77% green and 9.2% blue; R2BG3, 26.2% red, 70.2% green, and 3.5% blue; R3BG1, 42.3% red, 57.3% green, and 0.4% blue. Seedlings in the R3BG1 treatment generally showed faster growth and biomass accumulation in both shoot and root parts relative to the R1BG5 treatment. The red-light high spectmm also resulted in faster nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) uptake which countered nutrient deficiency in blue-high spectrum. Leaves expanded in area at highest efficiency in red-light high spectrum with even faster rate of biomass accumulation and nutrient uptake; while roots were proliferated faster in substrates but biomass allocation to roots was not modified by spectra so did root P uptake. Overall, B. striata should be cultured in redlight high spectrum and taken above-ground organs as the source of dry mass production. (C) 2020 Friends Science Publishers

AB  - Considering the increase in forage requirement in livestock, lack of same quality products throughout the year. fertilizer and chemical costs, insufficient water resources and environmental restrictions caused by climate change; studies providing solutions for forage production are getting more attention. Vertical farming which is the method of growing crops in vertically stacked layers under controlled environment is one of the promising techniques to protect environmental resources. provide continuous and sustainable forage production. Effect of light intensity on dry matter accumulation and physiology of barley fodder in a vertical farming growth module was investigated in the present study. The experiment was consisted of eight micro chambers represented the growth modules of vertical farming system placed in fully controlled growth chamber. There were four different light intensity, two repetitions each of 40, 100, 160 and 220 mu mol/m(2).s. Plants were sampled every day during all experimental period (8 days). Leaf area and fresh/dry weight of root and leaves were determined Furthermore, chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b and carotenoid contents of leaves were analyzed Module based water use of each light treatments were calculated In line with the results, higher light intensity was found to affect the dry matter accumulation positively; since the physiological properties of barley fodder growing under 160 and 220 mu mol/m(2).s. light intensity are almost the same, it is recommended to use 160 mu mol/m(2).s. light intensity in terms of energy saving. Based on the data obtained from the present micro-level lab-scale study revealed that the effect of factors such as temperature, humidity, water use and seeding density should also be examined in order to provide the best growing conditions for the future studies.

AB  - The rapid growth of the world's population, limited natural resources and environmental challenges caused by climate change have had brought up global food security to the agenda. Scientific researches and new practices considering sustainable food production and efficient use of natural resources are getting more attention during last decades all around the world. Furthermore, advanced technological applications that enable new agricultural production systems such as vertical farm have been starting to emerge to provide a solution on this issue. Vertical farming which is the method of growing crops in vertically stacked layers under controlled environment is one of the promising techniques to protect environmental resources, provide continuous and sustainable plant production. Applications of vertical farming have already experienced in many countries such as Japan, Singapore, England, USA, Netherlands and the vertical agricultural market is expected to increase by 25% by 2024 to reach 11.4 billion Euro. Plant groups that are widely grown with vertical farming system are mostly; carrot, radish, potato, tomato, pepper, pea, cabbage, spinach, lettuce and strawberries. Although, cereal grain production in the vertical systems is not economically profitable today, considering remarkable increase in demands on forage crops, barley fodder production seems to have great potential for vertical farming systems. The benefits of the system such as less water use (about 90%), no herbicides, pesticides and fertilizer application relative to conventional production would be more pronounced for barley fodder in vertical system comparison to other conventional forage crops production systems. In this review, potential of barley fodder production in vertical farming system was discussed.

AB  - We investigated the photosynthesis and growth of lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) grown under three light/dark cycles in a mini plant factory with artificial illumination. A relative longer light cycle [12/12 h (light/dark)] increased not only light-response curve parameters, such as light-saturated net photosynthetic rate, light-saturation point, light-compensation point, dark respiration rate, but also upregulated CO2-response curves parameters, such as CO2-saturated net photosynthetic rate, initial carboxylation efficiency, and photorespiration rate, compared to those of the shorter light cycles [6/6 h and 3/3 h (light/dark)]. A longer light cycle enhanced electron transfer potential, increased the chlorophyll amount, leaf area, and biomass and reduced the root/shoot ratio and the specific leaf area. Our results imply that the prolonged light cycle led to the increase in photosynthetic capacity and significantly enhanced the growth rate of lettuce.

AB  - Light is the major source of energy for plants and as such has a profound effect on plant growth and development. Red and blue lights have been considered to best drive photosynthetic metabolism and are beneficial for plant growth and development, and green light was seen as a signal to slow down or stop. In this study, Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) was used to investigate the effects of red, blue and green lights on the growth and development of plants from seed germination to seeding. Results demonstrated that red light showed a promotion effect but blue light a prohibition one in most stages except for the flowering time in which the effect of each light was just reversed. When mixed with red or blue light, green light generally at least partially cancelled out the effects caused by each of them. Results also showed that the same number of photons the plant received could cause different effects and choosing the right combination of different color of lights is essential in both promoting the growth and development of plants and reducing the energy consumption of lighting in plant factory.

AB  - With the rise of plant factories around the world, more and more crops are cultivated under artificial light. Studies on effects of lighting strategies on plant growth, such as different light intensities, photoperiods, and their combinations, have been widely conducted. However, research on application of multi-segment light strategies and associated plant growth mechanisms is still relatively lacking. In the present study, two lighting strategies, multi-segment light intensity and extended photoperiod, were compared with a constant light intensity with a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle and the same daily light integral (DLI). Both lighting strategies promoted plant growth but acted via different mechanisms. The multi-segment light intensity lighting strategy promoted plant growth by decreasing non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) of the excited state of chlorophyll and increasing the quantum yield of PSII electron transport (PhiPSII), quantum yield of the carboxylation rate (PhiCO(2)), and photochemical quenching (qP), also taking advantage of the circadian rhythm. The extended photoperiod lighting strategy promoted plant growth by compensating for weak light stress and increasing light-use efficiency by increasing chlorophyll content under weak light conditions.

AB  - Vertical farming has emerged in urban areas as an approach to provide more resilient food production. However, a substantial share of the material requirements come from outside their urban environments. With urban environments producing a large share of residual and waste streams, extensive potential exists to employ these material and energy streams as inputs in urban farming systems to promote more circular economy approaches. The aim of this article is to assess the environmental performance of employing residual material flows for vertical hydroponic farming in urban environments in order to support more circular, resilient, and sustainable urban food supply. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is used to assess replacing conventional growing media and fertilizers with urban residual streams. Paper, compost, and brewers' spent grains were assessed for replacements to conventional gardening soil employed in the studied system. Biogas digestate was also assessed as a replacement for conventional fertilizers used in the recirculating water bath. The results suggest that large environmental performance benefits are illustrated when conventional growing media is replaced. Although not as significant, employing fertilizers from residual urban streams also leads to large potential benefits, suggesting the two residual streams have the potential for more circular hydroponic systems.

AB  - Vertical farming is one of the suggested avenues for producing food for the growing world population. Concentrating the cultivation of crops such as herbs in large indoor farms makes food production susceptible to technical, biological or other problems that might destroy large amounts of food at once. Thus, there is a trend towards locally, self-sufficient food production in vertical systems on a small scale. Our study examined whether conventional knitted fabrics, such as patches of worn jackets, can be used for hydroponics instead of the specialized nonwoven materials used in large-scale indoor systems. To this end, seed germination and seedling growth of 14 different crop plant species on knitted fabrics with three different stitch sizes were compared. Our results showed that hydroponic culture on knitted fabrics are indeed possible and allow for growing a broad spectrum of plant species, suggesting recycling of old textile fabrics for this purpose. Among the 14 plant species studied, differences in germination success, average fresh and dry masses, as well as water contents were found, but these parameters were not affected by knitted fabric stitch size.

AB  - To rapidly produce strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa Duch. cv. Benihoppe) transplants from cuttings, suitable light intensities for unrooted runner plants at the rooting stage and rooted runner plants at the seedling stage were determined in a plant factory under LED lighting. At the rooting stage, unrooted runner plants at the 3-leaf stage were hydroponically rooted for 6 days under light intensity of 30, 90, 150, and 210 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), respectively. At the seedling stage, rooted runner plants were hydroponically grown for 18 days under light intensity of 90, 180, 270, and 360 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), respectively. The tube LED lights consisting of white and red LED chips were used as sole light source, and photoperiod was controlled as 16 h d(-1). The results showed that the maximum root number (7.7) and longest root length (14.8 cm) of the runner plants were found under 90 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) at the rooting stage. Photosynthetic activity in runner plant leaves under 90 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) were higher than that under 30, 150, and 210 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). Higher light intensity at the range of 90-270 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) increased the stomatal conductance of newly formed leaves of rooted runner plants, thus improving the net photosynthetic rate and growth of rooted runner plants at the seedling stage. The crown diameter, shoot and root dry weights, and root to shoot ratio of rooted runner plants increased by 9.7%, 38.8%, 106.1%, and 48.7%, respectively, when the light intensity increased from 90 to 270 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). However, there was no further improvement of runner plant growth under 360 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). Furthermore, no significant difference of increased dry biomass per mole of photons delivered was found between 180 and 270 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). In consideration of transplant quality and economic balance, light intensity of 90 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) at the rooting stage and 270 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) at the seedling stage were suggested for rapidly producing hydroponic strawberry transplants based on unrooted runner plants in the LED plant factory.

AB  - Problem, research strategy, and findings: How do traditional forms of urban agriculture and the newer digital urban agriculture converge and diverge from one another in terms of land use and gentrification? I interrogate the subject of digital urban agriculture with data from 82 semistructured interviews and notes taken during public forms and tours of facilities. Respondents were located in Denver (CO; n = 30), New York (NY; n = 26), and San Francisco (CA; n = 26) and held positions ranging from community organizers, investors, local food powerbrokers, and planners to engineers involved in facilitating urban foodways based on vertical farming, automation, and related technologies. I find digital platforms-systems exhibiting characteristics including real-time surveillance, artificial intelligence, and automation-share similarities with traditional urban farming systems. Both platforms have the potential to disrupt dominant political economies and also have links to gentrification and other inequitable land use patterns. Potential divergences include differences in a) social, cultural, economic, human, and built capital barriers and outcomes; b) land use life course; and c) zoning. Takeaway for practice: Digital urban farming systems inhabit a regulatory gray area; respondents encountered agricultural, industrial, or commercial zoning permits. The "digital" aspects of these systems contributed to this ambiguity and are used by powerbrokers to obtain further zoning permission than is possible with traditional urban agriculture. Compared with more traditional urban farming systems, digital urban agriculture taps into different forms of human capital. Finally, my findings are inconclusive on the issue of land use life course. Some data indicate digital farms will remain in urban cores, whereas other evidence points to the eventual migration of these platforms to the metropolitan periphery.

AB  - Ginsenosides are a class of natural product steroid glycosides and triterpene saponins with great therapeutic value. Although ginseng berries contain 4-10 times more ginsenosides than ginseng roots, a sustainable method has been established for ginseng root production but not for ginseng berry production. We elucidated the best conditions for stable berry production by cultivating four-year-old ginsengs on a developed vertical farm (VF) platform in a 3-level stereoscopic facility. Ginseng was cultivated in soil in mesh containers in three levels of cultivation shelves (W 0.85 m x D 4.80 m x H 1.15 m) installed in a cultivation room (W 5.88 m x 10.00 m x H 6.00 m). Each plant produced approximately 15 berries (3 g) in the VF, which is as many as those produced by plants in open fields (OF). Ginsenoside Rg1 and syringaresinol levels were higher in the berries from the VF than in those from the OF. In contrast, levels of total ginsenosides Rc, Rb2, and Rd were lower in berries from the VF than in those from the OF. Further, the levels of ginsenoside Re (major ginsenoside in ginseng berries from VF) were similar in the VF and OF. This difference in chemical composition can be attributed to the less variable environmental conditions in the VF compared to the OF. Berry yield strongly correlated with stem diameter and root weight. We thus conclude that this VF platform could be used to produce as many ginseng berries as an OF would produce. Additionally, it could be used for year-round production, thus enabling constant supply of therapeutically useful ginseng berries.

AB  - The continuing decline of arable land per person and global human population growth are raising concerns about food security. Recent advances in horticultural technology (i.e., growing using light-emitting diode (LED) lighting, hydroponics, vertical farming, and controlled environments) have changed the ways in which vegetables can be produced and supplied. The emerging technology makes it possible to produce more food using fewer resources, independent of the weather and the need for land. They allow bringing agricultural practices inside urban built up spaces and making horticultural production an integrated part of the daily life of urban residents. However, the process and consequences of this technology-driven transition on urban planning and development are hardly understood. This paper uses the theory of multi-level perspective (MLP) on sustainability transitions and actor-network theory (ANT) to explore this technology-driven transition and its adoption in urban planning and development. The high-tech horticulture zone development in Shanghai was used as a case study. The results show the importance of both social (i.e., policymakers and planners) and material (i.e., technologies and policy documents) actants in the transition of the sociotechnical regime. Furthermore, the transition toward sustainable urban horticulture practices requires the simultaneous preparation of supportive and compatible spatial development, agricultural and sustainable development policies, and adequate policy implementation and evaluation tools to increase the competitive strength of innovative practices.

AB  - Vegetative propagation of strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa Duch.) in the plant factory with artificial lighting is considered as an effective approach to produce high-quality transplants. In this study, mother plants of 'Benihoppe' strawberry were grown hydroponically for 50 d under eight LED lighting treatments by combining four levels of light intensity (200, 250, 300 and 350 mu mol/(m(2).s)) and two photoperiods (12 h/d and 16 h/d). Runner development, growth of runner plants, photon yield and energy yield in runners and runner plants were investigated to evaluate the strawberry propagation efficiency. Results indicated that length of runners decreased linearly with increasing daily light integral (DLI) under each photoperiod and was significantly shorter under photoperiod of 16 h/d. Runner elongation was inhibited by high DLI. Number of runners and runner plants formed by mother plants increased by 38.9% and 33.7%, when DLI increased from 8.6 to 11.5 mol/(m(2).d), respectively; however, no further increase was observed when DLI was higher than 11.5 mol/(m(2).d). Similar trends were found in crown diameter and biomass of primary and secondary runner plants. Negative impact of high DLI (20.2 mol/(m(2).d)) on photosynthetic capacity of runner plants was observed as a decrease in leaf net photosynthetic rate, potential maximum photochemical efficiency of PSII, and chlorophyll content. Furthermore, photon yield and energy yield in runners and runner plants decreased significantly with increasing DLI. Therefore, DLI in a range of 11.5-17.3 mol/(m(2).d) is beneficial to improve strawberry propagation efficiency and quality of runner plants, and 11.5 mol/(m(2).d) is optimal for the strawberry propagation of runner plants in the LED plant factory because of the higher photon and energy yields.

AB  - Since kale (Brassica oleracea L. var. acephala) is one of the healthiest vegetables, its cultivation is increasing for either fresh consumption or as a source for functional foods and nutraceuticals. Plant factories are able to control the environment and trigger the accumulation of bioactive compounds with a stable supply by systematic cultivation methods. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the changes in the total phenolic compounds (TPCs), total flavonoid compounds (TFCs), glucosinolates (GLSs), and antioxidant capacity of kale in a plant factory and to determine an optimal harvest time for the maximum annual production. Two cultivars, namely 'Manchoo collard' and 'Jangsoo collard', were cultivated in a plant factory and thinned to avoid mutual shading. Both cultivars were harvested every week from 14 to 49 days after transplanting (DAT). The fresh weight (FW), dry weight (DW), projected leaf area (PLA), TPCs, TFCs, GLSs, and antioxidant capacity of both plants were measured every week. The annual production was calculated as follows: DW x the concentration x planting density x cultivation cycles per year. The optimal harvest time was determined based on the continuous phase of the production by modeling. The FW and DW of both cultivars exponentially increased, but the PLA hardly increased at 35 DAT. The TPCs, TFCs, and antioxidant capacity fluctuated or slightly changed, but the amount of substance per plant gradually increased. Their annual production increased with increasing harvest time, and only the production of TPCs in 'Manchoo collard' showed a local maximum when harvested at 35-42 DAT. Glucoiberin, sinigrin, and glucobrassicin were the major components of GLSs in both cultivars, and their contents fluctuated. The concentration of total GLSs was the highest at 42 DAT. Additionally, the annual production of the total and major GLSs showed the same results as the TPCs, TFCs, and antioxidant capacity. From the results, the optimum harvest time for production was determined to be 42 DAT.

AB  - Facing the increase in world population and the stagnation in available arable land there is a high demand for optimizing the food production. Considering the world-wide and ongoing reduction of the agricultural labor force novel approaches for food production are required. Vertical farming may be such a solution where plants are being produced indoors in racks, cared by robotic appliances which will be operated by specialized software. Given the multitude of parameters which determine the ideal condition, a lot of data needs to be acquired. As this data is used to adapt the entire Cyber-Physical System to a changing environment the data has to be secure and adaptations have to consider safety aspects as well. Such systems must hence be secure, safe, scalable and self-adaptable to a high degree. We present an important element for such solutions, a cloud, IoT and robotic based smart farming framework.

AB  - Ultraviolet A (UV-A) light-emitting diodes (LEDs) could serve as an effective tool for improving the content of health-promoting bioactive compounds in plants in controlled-environment agriculture (CEA) systems. The goal of this study was to investigate the effects of UV-A LEDs at different wavelengths (366, 390, and 402 nm) and durations (10 and 16 h) on the growth and phytochemical contents of mustard microgreens (Brassica juncea L. cv. "Red Lion"), when used as supplemental light to the main LED lighting system (with peak wavelengths of 447, 638, 665, and 731 nm). Plants were grown for 10 days under a total photon flux density (TPFD) of 300 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) and 16-h light/8-h dark period. Different UV-A wavelengths and irradiance durations had varied effects on mustard microgreens. Supplemental UV-A radiation did not affect biomass accumulation; however, the longest UV-A wavelength (402 nm) increased the leaf area of mustard microgreens, regardless of the duration of irradiance. The concentration of the total phenolic content and alpha-tocopherol mostly increased under 402-nm UV-A, while that of nitrates increased under 366- and 390-nm UV-A at both radiance durations. The contents of lutein/zeaxanthin and beta-carotene increased in response to the shortest UV-A wavelength (366 nm) at 10-h irradiance as well as longer UV-A wavelength (390 nm) at 16 h irradiance. The most positive effect on the accumulation of mineral elements, except iron, was observed under longer UV-A wavelengths at 16-h irradiance. Overall, these results suggest that properly composed UV-A LED parameters in LED lighting systems could improve the nutritional quality of mustard microgreens, without causing any adverse effects on plant growth.

AB  - A plant factory with artificial lighting is an advanced indoor cultivation system that has been being developed rapidly for producing high-quality vegetables in many countries. Coriander is an important herbal vegetable and contains abundant secondary metabolites, vitamins, and minerals, which are essential for human health. Five different light qualities, red (R), blue (B), green (G), red:blue (RB, ratio of 87:13), and red:blue:far-red (RBFr, ratio of 81.5:12.5:6) were applied to identify the optimal light quality for enhancing the growth and accumulation of minerals and bioactive metabolites in coriander. Results showed that biomass, chlorophyll index, and ascorbic acid content of coriander plants were significantly higher in RB or RBFr light treatments than in other light treatments. The antioxidant capacity and total phenolic content were the highest under B light. The total phenolic content per plant was the highest under RBFr light due to the high growth rate and biomass production of the plants. Besides, tipburn occurrence in coriander was not affected by total Ca content in the shoot. RBFr was found to be the optimal light spectrum for producing coriander with high yield and contents of ascorbic acid, total phenolics, Ca, and P in a plant factory.

AB  - In this paper, we present a novel method for vision based plants phenotyping in indoor vertical farming under artificial lighting. The method combines 3D plants modeling and deep segmentation of the higher leaves, during a period of 25-30 days, related to their growth. The novelty of our approach is in providing 3D reconstruction, leaf segmentation, geometric surface modeling, and deep network estimation for weight prediction to effectively measure plant growth, under three relevant phenotype features: height, weight and leaf area. Together with the vision based measurements, to verify the soundness of our proposed method, we also harvested the plants at specific time periods to take manual measurements, collecting a great amount of data. In particular, we manually collected 2592 data points related to the plant phenotype and 1728 images of the plants. This allowed us to show with a good number of experiments that the vision based methods ensure a quite accurate prediction of the considered features, providing a way to predict plant behavior, under specific conditions, without any need to resort to human measurements.

AB  - Vertical farming is a novel type of food production in indoor environments with artificial lighting and controlled cultivation conditions. In this context, sustainability in small-scale indoor cultivation systems is crucial. Sustainability can be achieved by optimizing all the cultivation factors involved in the production process. The effects of different photoperiod conditions under different timing during plant development-from sowing to germination and maturity-have been studied in a small-scale indoor cultivation area. The main objective of this research was to investigate the possibilities of an optimized photoperiod for basil plants to reduce the energy demand cost of the cultivation unit. Three different photoperiod treatments (P8D16L, P10D14L, and P11D13L) were applied to basil plants with stable light intensity. Furthermore, the photoperiod was shortened to test the reaction of the biomass from the plants in a reduced energy demand system. The dry biomass produced was measured along with the energy consumed in each treatment. The basil quality was assessed by measuring different physiological indices, such as chlorophyll a (Chl a), chlorophyll b (Chl b), total chlorophyll (Chl tot), the fraction of photosynthetically active irradiance absorbed by the leaf, and leaf temperature. The results of the study showed that a shorter photoperiod did not negatively affect the quantity and quality of the basil plants. Continuously, the evaluation of the energy demand variation under the different photoperiod treatments can provide a significant positive impact on the energetic, ecological, and economic aspects of small-scale food production.

AB  - Few researchers examined different red light amounts added in white light-emitting diodes (LEDs) with varied daily light integrals (DLIs) for hydroponic lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.). In this study, effects of DLI and LED light quality (LQ) on growth, nutritional quality, and energy use efficiency of hydroponic lettuce were investigated in a plant factory with artificial lighting (PFAL). Hydroponic lettuce plants (cv. Ziwei) were grown for 20 days under 20 combinations of five levels of DLIs at 5.04, 7.56, 10.08, 12.60, and 15.12 mol.m(-2).d(-1) and four LQs: two kinds of white LEDs with red to blue ratio (R:B ratio) of 0.9 and 1.8, and two white LEDs plus red chips with R:B ratio of 2.7 and 3.6, respectively. Results showed that leaf and root weights and power consumption based on fresh and dry weights increased linearly with increasing DLI, and light and electrical energy use efficiency (LUE and EUE) decreased linearly as DLI increased. However, no statistically significant differences were found in leaf fresh and dry weights and nitrate and vitamin C contents between DLI at 12.60 and 15.12 mol.m(-2).d(-1). Also, no effects of LQ on leaf dry weight of hydroponic lettuce were observed at a DLI of 5.04 mol.m(-2).d(-1). White plus red LEDs with an R:B ratio of 2.7 resulted in higher leaf fresh weight than the two white LEDs. LUE increased by more than 20% when red light fraction increased from 24.2% to 48.6%. In summary, white plus red LEDs with an R:B ratio of 2.7 at DLI at 12.60 mol.m(-2).d(-1) were recommended for commercial hydroponic lettuce (cv. Ziwei) production in PFALs.

AB  - Plant factory can provide stable crop cultivation environment, shorten cultivation duration, and deliver better produce quality by controlling temperature, humidity, lighting, nutrient supply, and other cultivating factors. Due to the high cost of operation, how to select crops and plan the cultivation schedule to enhance profitability is an important issue. In this research, the plant factory scheduling problem was formulated as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem. The objective function is to seek the maximum revenue by considering several practical operating conditions such as (1) crop market value per unit and time, (2) crop adjacency issue, (3) cleaning and maintenance, and (4) sunlight blocking by solar panel on the roof. Although the scheduling problem can be solved by the optimization solver, it presents challenges of rack-level modification when applying the optimization method on the field. Therefore, this study further developed a heuristic algorithm, named Heuristic Plant Factory Scheduler (HPFS), which applies a recursive technique to schedule crops rack by rack. This approach provides ease of implementation and modification. The experimental results show that HPFS is able to accelerate the computational performance with acceptable scheduling quality when the problem space is large.

AB  - Although outside the photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) waveband (400-700 nm), far-red (FR; 700-800 nm) radiation regulates photomorphogenesis and photochemistry, thereby meriting consideration in sole-source plant-lighting applications. We investigated how FR radiation interacted with the ratio of blue (B; 400-500 nm) to red (R; 600-700 nm) radiation (B:R) (experiment I) and PPFD (experiment II) to regulate seedling growth under sole-source lighting. We postulated that adding FR radiation to B + R radiation would increase leaf expansion and thus radiation capture to promote whole-plant photosynthesis, but that FR effects would depend on B:R and PPFD. In experiment I, lettuce (Lactuca saliva) 'Rex' and 'Cherokee' and basil (Ocimwn basilicum) 'Genovese' were continuously irradiated by 180 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) of B and/or R radiation [B30R150 (low B:R), B90R90 (high B:R), R-180, or B-180, where subscripts indicate respective photon flux densities in mu mol m(-2) s(-1)] with or without 30 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) of FR radiation. Twelve and 16 days after seed sow for lettuce and basil, respectively, the addition of FR radiation increased leaf length and shoot weight of all crops with more pronounced impacts under high B:R than low B:R. It also increased root dry weight of basil and lettuce 'Cherokee'. Adding FR to B + R radiation reduced specific chlorophyll content in lettuce by 10-20%, but not in basil. Red pigmentation of lettuce 'Cherokee' increased with increasing B:R but decreased with the inclusion of FR radiation. In experiment II, we grew lettuce 'Rex' (for 8 days) and 'RouxaF' (for 10 days) under B90R90 (low PPFD) or B180R180 (high PPFD) at the same B:R with or without FR radiation at 30 or 75 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). Additional FR radiation increased lettuce shoot weight and extension growth but reduced relative specific chlorophyll content under both PPFDs, although FR effects were attenuated under the high PPFD. Shoot dry weight, relative specific chlorophyll content, and red foliage pigmentation increased with PPFD. We conclude that FR enrichment improves photosynthetic radiation capture and thus promotes crop growth under sole-source lighting, and that its effects are especially pronounced under high B:R and a low PPFD.

AB  - The recent increased market demand for locally grown produce is generating interest in the application of techniques developed for controlled environment agriculture (CEA) to urban agriculture (UA). Controlled environments have great potential to revolutionize urban food systems, as they offer unique opportunities for year-round production, optimizing resource-use efficiency, and for helping to overcome significant challenges associated with the high costs of production in urban settings. For urban growers to benefit from CEA, results from studies evaluating the application of controlled environments for commercial food production should be considered. This review includes a discussion of current and potential applications of CEA for UA, references discussing appropriate methods for selecting and controlling the physical plant production environment, resource management strategies, considerations to improve economic viability, opportunities to address food safety concerns, and the potential social benefits from applying CEA techniques to UA. Author's viewpoints about the future of CEA for urban food production are presented at the end of this review.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) has been integrated in various applications such as smart homes and smart cities. IoT in agriculture such as in monitoring indoor climatic conditions can help to improve the plant growth. This paper proposes a new approach in utilizing IoT technology as a remote monitoring system to control the indoor climatic conditions via light emitting diode (LED) parameters which include spectrums, photoperiod and intensity in order to increase yields as well as to reduce the turnaround time. This study showed that growth of Brassica chinensis under different wavelengths of light source has influenced plant growth performance and phytochemicals characteristics. Four different light treatments were experimented using pulse treatment (1 h light and 1 h dark), continuous light (CL), high intensity and artificial light control of 12 h light and 12 h dark. Data such as the leaves count, height, dry weight and chlorophyll a & b of plants were analyzed. The results showed high mean value of plants' fresh weight (FW) of 410.77 g under pulse treatment compared to other light treatments. The percentage of moisture content (MC) was recorded higher on average under normal light (99.15%), value of leaf area (LA) was recorded higher under artificial sunlight with an average value of 976.84 cm(2). Even though the results of LA were better under artificial sunlight, CL with low intensity gave higher stem height (SH) and number of leaves (NOL). In order to capture real-time data and monitor the environmental parameters of the plant experiment, an intelligent embedded system was developed to automate the LED control and manipulation. The results showed that the system is stable and has significant referential in the area of plant factory or indoor farming.

AB  - Plant factories are perceived as a sustainable agricultural production system, since they provide a cultivation environment for growing agricultural crops with less resource consumption and no pesticide use. However, as the industry and academic participants have been contributing in the development of plant factory technology, consumer acceptance for the crops cultivated from that technology remains unknown. Without consumer acceptance, all the costs spent in the research and development (RD) of plant factories cannot gain the profit. To address this deficiency, this study was aimed to: (1) investigate consumers' attitudes, concerns and willingness to pay for the vegetables cultivated with plant factories, (2) explore the branding mode that is most effective for selling plant factory vegetables to consumers, and (3) determine the influence of consumers' socio-demographics and vegetable purchase behavior for their willingness to pay for plant factory vegetables. With a modified strategy of multi-stage cluster sampling, a consumer survey was conducted and 390 valid questionnaires were obtained for statistical analysis. Data were analyzed with descriptive statistical analysis, analysis of variance, Duncan's post hoc analysis, and regression analysis to meet the study objectives. The study results indicated that over half of the subjects appreciated the value of plant factory technology. However, as high as 64.4% of the subjects revealed concerns. Most of the concerns were about the issues of environmental pollution and food safety. It also showed that price played a decisive role for consumers' purchase intentions to plant factory vegetables. Moreover, consumers were more willing to pay a higher price for the plant factory vegetables labeled with an allied brand of academic institutes and private corporations, compared with those labeled with other types of brand. Consumers who had higher income and/or consume more organic vegetables were also more willing to pay for the plant factory vegetables. The study findings help the industry participants to build up effective market strategies for selling the crops cultivated with sustainable plant factory systems.

AB  - The extensive environment, especially low temperature and weak lighting in winter and spring, which limits the growth of pepper (Capicum annuum L.) seedlings, the use of plant factory with artificial lighting technology can effectively control the lighting environment to produce high-quality seedlings. In this study, white LED lamps with R:B ratio of 0.7 (L0.7) and 1.5 (L1.5) and red-blue LED lamps with R:B ratio of 3.5 (L3.5) were used to cultivate seedlings of "CAU-24" pepper in the light intensity of 250 mu mol/m(2).s and photoperiod of 12 h/d, white fluorescent lamps with R:B ratio of 1.7 (F1.7) was used as control. The results showed that plant height, stem diameter, hypocotyl length, biomass accumulation, light energy use efficiency (LUE) and electric energy use efficiency (EUE) of pepper seedling under L1.5 were the highest. After 36 days of sowing, the dry weight of shoot reached 302.8 +/- 45.2 mg/plant. Leaf area reached maximum value of 153.5 +/- 22.0 cm(2) under L0.7. The contents of chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b and total chlorophyll of pepper seedling leaves under all kinds of LED light were greater than F1.7, but there was no significant difference in net photosynthetic rate. The total dry weight with lamp electric power consumption of L1.5 were 3.0 g/(kW.h) which was 1.5, 2, and 3 times greater than that of L3.5, L0.7, and F1.7, respectively. Therefore, compared with fluorescent lamp and other LED lamps, the white LED light quality with R:B ratio of 1.5 is suitable for pepper seedling production in plant factory because of the high LED lighting efficiency, greater LUE and EUE.

AB  - Fresh produce within vertical farming systems grows vertically in different layers stacked atop each other, thus allowing for the efficient use of space. As the environment in vertical farming systems is completely controlled, neither sunlight nor soil is necessary. On the one hand, vertical farming may help to provide a healthy diet for the growing global population because it has a greater crop yield per square meter used than conventional farming; moreover, it can offer the opportunity to grow food in climatically disadvantaged areas. On the other hand, growth conditions may be perceived as unnatural and the entire vertical farming system as unsustainable. Therefore, understanding the consumers' acceptance of vertical farming systems is important. This study is the first work to provide insights into consumers' acceptance of three different vertical farming systems. Data are collected through an online survey of 482 consumers in Germany in February 2018. Drivers of consumer acceptance of vertical farming systems are identified through structural equation modelling. The results indicate that perceived sustainability is the major driver of consumer acceptance of vertical farming systems. The larger the system, the higher the likelihood that it will be considered as sustainable. Obviously, consumers perceive something like ecologies of scale.

AB  - With an expanding population and changing dynamics in global food markets, it is important to find solutions for more resilient food production methods closer to urban environments. Recently, vertical farming systems have emerged as a potential solution for urban farming. However, although there is an increasing body of literature reviewing the potential of urban and vertical farming systems, only a limited number of studies have reviewed the sustainability of these systems. The aim of this article was to understand the environmental impacts of vertical hydroponic farming in urban environments applied to a case study vertical hydroponic farm in Stockholm, Sweden. This was carried out by evaluating environmental performance using a life cycle perspective to assess the environmental impacts and comparing to potential scenarios for improvement options. The results suggest that important aspects for the vertical hydroponic system include the growing medium, pots, electricity demand, the transportation of raw materials and product deliveries. By replacing plastic pots with paper pots, large reductions in GHG emissions, acidification impacts, and abiotic resource depletion are possible. Replacing conventional gardening soil as the growing medium with coir also leads to large environmental impact reductions. However, in order to further reduce the impacts from the system, more resource-efficient steps will be needed to improve impacts from electricity demand, and there is potential to develop more symbiotic exchanges to employ urban wastes and by-products.

AB  - Global challenges such as climate change, increasing urbanization and a lack of transparency of food chains, have led to the development of innovative urban food production approaches, such as rooftop greenhouses, vertical farms, indoor farms, aquaponics as well as production sites for edible insects or micro-algae. Those approaches are still at an early stage of development and partly unknown among the public. The aim of our study was to identify the perception of sustainability, social acceptability and ethical aspects of these new approaches and products in urban food production. We conducted 19 qualitative expert interviews and applied qualitative content analysis. Our results revealed that major perceived benefits are educational effects, revaluation of city districts, efficient resource use, exploitation of new protein sources or strengthening of local economies. Major perceived conflicts concern negative side-effects, legal constraints or high investment costs. The extracted acceptance factors deal significantly with the "unknown". A lack of understanding of the new approaches, uncertainty about their benefits, concerns about health risks, a lack of familiarity with the food products, and ethical doubts about animal welfare represent possible barriers. We conclude that adaptation of the unsuitable regulatory framework, which discourages investors, is an important first step to foster dissemination of the urban food production approaches.

AB  - Next to its intensity, the spectral composition of light is one of the most important factors affecting plant growth and morphology. The introduction of light emitting diodes (LEDs) offers perspectives to design optimal light spectra for plant production systems. However, knowledge on the effects of light quality on physiological plant processes is still limited. The aim of this study is to determine the effects of six light qualities on growth and plant architecture of young tomato plants, and to upscale these effects to the crop level using a multispectral, functional-structural plant model. Young tomato plants were grown under 210 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) blue, green, amber, red, white or red/blue (92%/8%) LED light with a low intensity of sunlight as background. Plants grown under blue light were shorter and developed smaller leaves which were obliquely oriented upward. Leaves grown under blue light contained the highest levels of light harvesting pigments, but when exposed to blue light only, they had the lowest rate of leaf photosynthesis. However, when exposed to white light these leaves had the highest rate of photosynthesis. Under green light, tomato plants were taller and leaves were nearly horizontally oriented, with a high specific leaf area. The open plant structure combined with a high light transmission and reflection at the leaf level allowed green light to penetrate deeper into the canopy. Plants grown under red, amber and white light were comparable with respect to height, leaf area and biomass production. The 3D model simulations indicated that the observed changes in plant architecture had a significant impact on light absorbance at the leaf and crop level The combination of plant architecture and spectrum dependent photosynthesis was found to result in the highest rate of crop photosynthesis under red light in plants initially grown under green light. These results suggest that dynamic light spectra may offer perspectives to increase growth and production in high value production systems such as greenhouse horticulture and vertical farming.

AB  - The interaction between agriculture, particularly intensive greenhouse horticulture, and climate, is of dual nature. The resources required to produce crops, such as fossil fuel, affect climate change (CC), which, in turn, will backfire with altered growing conditions in the future. For instance, phenomena like heat waves and severe droughts would significantly affect management of protected cultivation systems, which would require adaptation processes. This puts greenhouse vegetable producers under high pressure, as they are required to adopt environmentally friendly production strategies. Here, we provide a comprehensive critical review of the effects of present and future CC scenarios on controlled environment agriculture as well as the mapping of climate protection measures in these environments. We examined published articles from 1990 to 2019, focused mainly on the European region and pinpointing the differences between the temperate North and the Mediterranean basin, although some research works from other regions were also considered. We recommend adaptations in terms of sufficient cooling, and improvement of natural and additional light for winter production. Technical and conceptual innovations such as the semi-/closed greenhouse based on mechanical cooling and dehumidification are discussed along with structural solutions such as passively ventilated greenhouses and screenhouses. Moreover, we recommend adaptation in terms of cultivar selection, greenhouse type, cover material, cultural practices and production technology to cope with abnormal climate alterations and extreme weather conditions associated with CC. We believe that this work will contribute to advance sustainable year-round production. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The projected increase of the world's population, coupled with the shrinking area of arable land required to meet future food demands, is building pressure on Earth's finite agricultural resources. As an alternative to conventional farming methods, crops can be grown in protected environments, such as traditional greenhouses or the more modern plant factories. These are usually more productive and use resources more efficiently than conventional farming and are now receiving much attention-especially in urban and peri-urban areas. Traditionally, protected cropping has been predominantly practised in temperate climates, but interest is rapidly rising in hot, arid areas and humid, tropical regions. However, maintaining suitable climatic conditions inside protected cropping structures in warm climates-where warm is defined as equivalent to climatic conditions that require cooling-is challenging and requires different approaches from those used in temperate conditions. In this paper, we review the benefits of protected cropping in warm climates, as well as the technologies available for maintaining a controlled growing environment in these regions. In addition to providing a summary of active cooling methods, this study summarises photovoltaic (PV)-based shading methods used for passive cooling of greenhouses. Additionally, we also summarise the current humidity-control techniques used in the protected cropping industry and identify future research opportunities in this area. The review includes a list of optimum growing conditions for a range of crop species suited to protected cropping in warm climates.

AB  - Light quality has a substantial effect on crops in plant factories. Quantum dot (QD) refers to ultrafine semiconductor particles and is expressed in a variety of wavelength ranges and fine and precise colors and is attracting attention as a next-generation material. This study was conducted to investigate the effects of various light qualities, including a QD-LED light source on the growth and color development of red romaine lettuce in the LED chamber system for plant factories. The light source was red fluorescent (FL), blue (B), red (R), blue + red mixed light (BR), and blue + wide range red + red mixed light QD-LED. The growth index, chlorophyll content, and leaf color were examined. The results showed that the plant length was long without a significant difference in QD-LED and the red (R) wavelength and showed the fastest growth under QD-LED. The photosynthetic rate and chlorophyll content were the highest in QD-LED light with a broad spectrum of red light. The leaf colors a*, b*, the hue angle, and total anthocyanin content showed the highest in QD-LED light, while b* and the hue angle values were the lowest. As the light wavelength range was changed, there was a significant difference in the growth response and leaf color, and it is considered that QD-LED light should be considered positively when applied to plant factories.

AB  - Humidity control is an important factor affecting the overall sustainability, productivity, and energy efficiency of controlled environment agriculture. Liquid desiccants offer the potential for pinpoint control of humidity levels in controlled environments. In the present work, a dehumidification processes utilizing liquid desiccants pumped through the lumens of triple-bore PVDF hollow fibre membranes is implemented in a bench scale controlled environment agriculture system. Hydrophobic hollow fibre membranes were combined into an array and placed near the crops. Concentrated magnesium chloride liquid desiccant solution with a low vapour pressure was pumped through the hollow fibre lumens. The dehumidification permeance rate responded dynamically to the changing transpiration rate of the plants, as influenced by changes in environmental factors such as light, temperature, and vapour pressure. The dehumidification permeance rate increased from an average of 0.26-0.31 g m(-2)h(-1) Pa-1 as the velocity of the liquid desiccant through the hollow fibres increased from 0.023 to 0.081 m s(-1). Humidity levels were targeted to be maintained within a range of 70-90% relative humidity at 23 degrees C. The membrane-based liquid desiccant system was demonstrated to successfully control humidity within a bench-scale controlled environment agricultural setup. (C) 2019 IAgrE. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - To understand the dynamic changes of lettuce growth, ascorbate pool and metabolism under long-term red and blue continuous light (CL, 24/0 h, 200 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1)), growth parameters, ascorbate pool size, as well as activities and gene expression levels of key enzymes involved in the ascorbate metabolism in lettuce leaves were investigated every 3 days during 15 days. In comparison with normal photoperiod (Control, 16/8 h, 200 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1)), lettuce plants gained greater shoot fresh weight and dry matter under CL, which depended more on specific leaf weight than leaf area. Both reduced ascorbate (MA) and dehydroascorbate (DHA) contents were remarkably enhanced by CL and keep a relatively stable level during the experiment. The consistent greater contents of AsA and DHA were respectively attributed to the up -regulation of L-galactono-1,4-lactone dehydrogenase and ascorbate peroxidase activity rather than their gene expression. Although glutathione contents and glutathione reductase activities were elevated by CL, their contribution to MA regeneration was limited on account of similar activity and expression level of dehydroascorbate reductase with control. In addition, H202 content was also raised obviously under CL compared with control, but it was maintained at a relative safety and stable level from day 6. Fluorescence imaging results also showed that CL did not induce oxidative damage on lettuce leaves compared with control. It is concluded that lettuce plants grown under red and blue continuous light for 15 days obtained greater shoot biomass and ascorbate pool size without leaf injury, and 9 days was the most cost-effective duration for yield improvement from an energy standpoint. Ascorbate accumulation under continuous light was primarily and rapidly regulated by the enzymes involved in AsA biosynthesis and oxidation at enzymatic activity level rather than gene expression level.

AB  - To establish an effective leaf area model in a mini plant factory with artificial lighting (mini-PFAL) environment, we conducted three experiments exposing lettuce plants to different light cycles. Three treatments were set up in the first experiment: 12-h/12-h (light/dark), 6-h/6-h (light/dark), and 3-h/3-h (light/dark). We analyzed the dynamic changes in the lettuce leaf area under different light cycles in a mini-PFAL and established a leaf area model based on the accumulated product of thermal effectiveness and photosynthetically active radiation (TEP) method. Data from two subsequent experiments were used to validate the lettuce leaf area model and uncover the difference in plant growth caused by different light/dark cycle patterns from a physiological perspective. Results show that the TEP and light cycle influenced lettuce leaf area significantly. Under 12-h/12-h (light/dark) treatment, lettuce growth was better than in 6-h/6-h (light/dark) and 3-h/3-h (light/dark) conditions within the same TEP. The light cycle appeared to significantly affect the leaf area as well as morphogenesis. The shape of lettuce leaves was slenderer and the leaf angle was steeper under the longer light cycle. We believed the different illumination durations in a single light cycle altered the functional relationships between phytochromes and led to different plant shapes. At the same time, the plant shape caused different light interceptions that affected the growth and leaf areas. A relative longer light period (6-h light/6-h dark) increased leaf stomata] conductance, net photosynthetic rate, and plant growth, compared to those of a shorter light period (3-h light/3-h dark). Based on these results, this study provides useful insights on regulation strategies related to light cycles and their effects on lettuce growth.

AB  - Light-emitting diode (LED) lights have recently been applied in controlled environment agriculture toward growing vegetables of various assortments, including microgreens. Spectral qualities of LED light on photosynthesis in microgreens are currently being studied for their ease of spectral optimization and high photosynthetic efficiency. This review aims to summarize the most recent discoveries and advances in specific phytochemical biosyntheses modulated by LED and other conventional lighting, to identify research gaps, and to provide future perspectives in this emerging multidisciplinary field of research and development. Specific emphasis was made on the effect of light spectral qualities on the biosynthesis of phenolics, carotenoids, and glucosinolates, as these phytochemicals are known for their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory effects, and many health benefits. Future perspectives on enhancing biosynthesis of these bioactives using the rapidly progressing LED light technology are further discussed.

AB  - Horticultural greenhouse production in circumpolar regions (>60 degrees N latitude), but also at lower latitudes, is dependent on artificial assimilation lighting to improve plant performance and the profitability of ornamental crops, and to secure production of greenhouse vegetables and berries all year round. In order to reduce energy consumption and energy costs, alternative technologies for lighting have been introduced, including light-emitting diodes (LED). This technology is also well-established within urban farming, especially plant factories. Different light technologies influence biotic and abiotic conditions in the plant environment. This review focuses on the impact of light quality on plant-microbe interactions, especially non-phototrophic organisms. Bacterial and fungal pathogens, biocontrol agents, and the phyllobiome are considered. Relevant molecular mechanisms regulating light-quality-related processes in bacteria are described and knowledge gaps are discussed with reference to ecological theories.

AB  - In the accumulation response, chloroplasts move toward weak blue light, staying at positions along the periclinal cell wall. By contrast, in the avoidance response, chloroplasts move away from strong blue light, escaping to positions along the anticlinal cell wall. The accumulation response maximizes light capture and the avoidance response reduces photodamage. The intracellular positioning of chloroplasts is important for optimizing photosynthesis and may have common signals with the regulators that determine leaf morphology, another factor that affects photosynthesis. Here, we propose that intracellular chloroplast position can be used to predict prospective leaf morphology in lettuce (Lactuca saliva). To test this, we induced the accumulation or avoidance response in lettuce cells through exposure to the appropriate strength of blue light and observed the growth of the plants. Our results indicated that leaf area increased in response to weak blue light inducing the accumulation response, and leaf thickness increased in response to strong blue light inducing the avoidance response.

AB  - A multi-story stacked protected farm is a high-tech structure for growing vegetables on multi-stacks in each floor under optimally controlled environments in a location where the weather or the soil is not conducive. An attempt has been made in this paper to evaluate economic of a six-story protected farm on a land in Delhi city, India, that having 3-layered stacked in each story. The study revealed that crop yield under the multi-story stacked protected farming system is significantly high. The initial unit cost of construction of the farm is high, but the operating cost is very less. It has several eco-friendly advantages compared with open field farming. Importantly, growing food within cities prevents the need for transportation of crops from distant farmlands to urban areas which reduces the food transportation carbon footprint.

AB  - Pressure on agricultural land from a rising global population is necessitating the maximisation of food production per unit area of cultivation. Attention is increasingly turning to Vertical Farming (VF) approaches in an attempt to provide a greater crop yield per square meter of land. However, this term has been used to cover a broad range of approaches, from personal- or community-scale vegetable and herb growing to vast skyscrapers for commercial production of a wide range of crops. This article summarises the main categories of VF in order to help clarify this emerging but sometimes confusing area of agriculture and discusses how scientific investigation of the potential of VF is currently lacking and will be required to help determine its feasibility as a method to assist meaningfully in global food production.

AB  - By 2050, it is estimated that 70% of the world's population will live in urban areas. This growth in cities creates a demand for fresh produce to ensure a healthy population, produce that often has to travel a long way to reach the consumer, not only losing quality and nutrition along the way, but also requiring a significant fossil fuel cost for transportation and storage. The average plate of food will travel over 2400 km before it reaches your plate. There is potential within District heating (DH) areas to move farming indoors and into the heart of the urban environment. Vertical hydroponic farming (VHF) offers many advantages over conventional farming including more efficient water and land use, and vastly reduced transport costs if it is performed in the urban area. For this model to become economically sustainable however, it must be intelligently integrated into existing urban infrastructure. A mutually beneficial relationship with DH is possible whereby VHFs are integrated to feed back into the DH system, lower the return temperature in line with 4th Generation District Heating guidelines, and reduce CO2 emissions in food and energy production.

AB  - High energy-use cost for electric lighting is one of the major issues challenging sustainability of the indoor lettuce-farming industry. Thus, maximizing electrical energy-use efficiency (EUE, g.KWh(-1)), defined as the ratio of dry matter production (g) to electrical energy consumption (EEC, KWh(-1)), is crucial during indoor production. Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are energy efficient and highly suitable for indoor farms. Research on optimal spectral quality of LEDs for lettuce growth is extensive; however, there is limited research examining LED spectral quality effects on EEC and EUE. Photon efficiency, defined as the ratio of light output to electrical energy input (PE, mu mol.J(-1)), generally is used for selection of LED fixtures. Because PE does not account for differences in emitted light spectrum, it is not clear whether light-fixture selection based on PE can maximize EUE in lettuce production. This study comprised two experiments. In Expt. 1, we used four "phosphor-converted'' commercial LEDs with different light intensities and spectra to model the effect of light spectral quality on lettuce shoot dry weight (SDW), EEC, and EUE. We also evaluated relations between EUE vs. PE and EUE vs. PER (PE based on red light) for indoor lettuce production. Results indicated that light spectral quality affected SDW, EEC, and EUE in lettuce production. Fitted models indicated that EEC increased linearly with increasing percentage of red-light output and was unaffected by other spectral colors or ratios. However, EUE increased in a curvilinear fashion with an increasing ratio of red to blue (R:B) light and reached a maximum at a ratio of 4.47. Similar to EUE, SDW also responded in a curvilinear fashion to R:B. Results also indicated that EUE correlated poorly with PE but linearly to PER. In Expt. 2, we grew three lettuce varieties under two commercial LED fixtures. They had similar levels of PE but different percentages of red, R:B, and PER values. Regardless of the variety, fixtures with greater percentages of red, R:B, and PER significantly increased EUE. We conclude that red-light quality is an important determinant of EUE and growers should select fixtures based on R:B and high PER in indoor lettuce farming.

AB  - Coriander is an important aromatic plant, and contains abundant secondary metabolites that are considered to be beneficial for health. The demand for high-quality and fresh coriander in large cities has been growing rapidly. Plant factories are advanced indoor cultivation systems that can produce high-quality plants inside cities with a high productivity. This study aimed to maximize plant growth and the secondary metabolites production of coriander, by regulating photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) and root-zone temperature (RZT). Three PPFDs (100, 200, and 300 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) and three RZTs (20, 25, and 30 degrees C) were applied on coriander plants grown hydroponically in a plant factory. The plant biomass and water content of leaf and stem were highest under RZT of 25 degrees C with a PPFD of 300 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). However, chlorogenic acid, rutin, trans-2-decenal, total phenolic concentrations and the antioxidant capacity of the coriander plant were greatest under the combination of PPFD (300 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) and RZT (30 degrees C). Chlorogenic acid in leaves responded more sensitively to PPFD and RZT than rutin. Controlling PPFD and RZT is effective in optimizing the yield and quality of coriander plants. The findings are expected to be applied to commercial plant production in plant factories.

AB  - Automation has intervened in all our day to day activities and we humans, nowadays, have become so used to it that we expect everything in our day to day life to be automated. Yet there are some fields that still require developments in various levels and one such field is Agriculture. Agriculture is an essential field which is in dire need for advancements. With the ever growing population and racing industrialization it is high time that we concentrate on smart farming techniques like hydroponics, aquaponics, etc. These techniques can be adopted so that it is easy to manage and regulate the vegetation under a more controlled environment with the proper application of concentrated nutrient solution to the plants. This paper describes about the automatic control system with latest electronic technology using microcontroller. The plants are well grown in the automated environment in the absence of soil with all the essential nutrients supplied artificially to the plants. The monitoring parameters are temperature, light, humidity, and soil moisture.

AB  - This paper proposes an IoT-based intelligent hydroponic plant factory solution called PlantTalk. The novelty of our approach is that the PlantTalk intelligence can be built through an arbitrary smartphone. We show that PlantTalk can flexibly configure the connections of various plant sensors and actuators through a smartphone. One can also conveniently write Python programs for plant-care intelligence through the smart phone. The developed plant-care intelligence includes automatic LED lighting, water spray, water pump and so on. As an example, we show that the PlantTalk intelligence effectively lowers the CO2 concentration, and the reduction speed is 53% faster than a traditional plant system. PlantTalk has been extended for a plant factory called AgriTalk.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the effect of the red (R)-to-blue (B) ratio of light on the growth and phenolic compounds of Crepidiastrum denticulatum under a phytochrome photostationary state(PSS) for growth in a plant factory with artificial light (PFAL) using light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Three-week-old C. denticulatum seedlings were transplanted into a PFAL where the air temperature, relative humidity, CO2 concentration, and light period were set at 20 degrees C, 60%, 1000molmol(-1), and 16h, respectively. Three controls were used with different ratios of R to B light without supplemental FR light: 8:2, 7:3, and 6:4 (based on chip number; 130 mu molm(-2)s(-1) photosynthetic photon flux density). For the treatments, the same R to B light ratios as in the controls were used but supplemented with FR light, plus a treatment with only R light supplemented with FR, set to a PSS of 0.71. Growth characteristics and total phenolic and individual phenolic contents were measured after a 6-week treatment. When the R light ratio increased, shoot dry weight, leaf length, leaf width, and leaf area increased regardless of supplemental FR light, and the R8B2 with FR light treatment was the most effective, with significantly higher values (1.6-2 times) than the control. FR irradiation did not have any negative effect on total phenolic content, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, and chicoric acid per unit dry weight (g); thus, the R8B2 with FR treatment had significantly higher total phenolic and individual phenolic contents per shoot (43% and 52-62%, respectively). Thus, supplemental lighting with FR LEDs was found to be effective to enhance the growth and bioactive compounds of C. denticulatum in a PFAL installed with a R and B lighting system, and the effectiveness could be changed by the RB ratio, with 8:2 considered the proper ratio.

AB  - Controlled environment agriculture (CEA) is an emerging form of farming increasingly found in cities world-wide. Advocates promote CEA as the future of food production, arguing for its potential to address challenges ranging from climate change to food insecurity. Detractors state that CEA's narrow focus on high-end produce, along with its intensive capital and energy needs, limit its meaningful contribution to the urban food system. Over the last seven years, New York City has become an epicenter for urban CEA, offering planners an in-situ setting in which to evaluate its impact. The following case study examines the current state of CEA in New York City, its composition, requirements, and future. The authors identify CEA's relative contributions, which include providing a small number of green-sector jobs and increasing access to produce in low-income communities. In parallel, they question if CEA provides sufficient benefits to warrant public-sector support. Recommendations for cities considering CEA include critically analyzing its purported benefits; evaluating the environmental, economic and social potential of projects located on publicly-owned rooftops and land; and focusing incentives on nonprofit and institutional production that show clear community benefits.

AB  - The effects of the quality and intensity of night interruption light (NIL) on the flowering and morphogenesis of kalanchoe (Kalanchoe blossfeldiana) Lipstick' and Spain' were investigated. Plants were raised in a closed-type plant factory under 250 molm(-2)s(-1) PPFD white light emitting diodes (LEDs) with additional light treatments. These treatments were designated long day (LD, 16 h light, 8 h dark), short day (SD, 8 h light, 16 h dark), and SD with a 4 h night interruption (NI). The NIL was constructed from 10 molm(-2)s(-1) or 20 molm(-2)s(-1) PPFD blue (NI-B), red (NI-R), white (NI-W), or blue and white (NI-BW) LEDs. In Spain', the SPAD value, area and thickness of leaves and plant height increased in the NI treatment as compared to the SD treatment. In Lipstick', most morphogenetic characteristics in the NI treatment showed no significant difference to those in the SD treatment. For both cultivars, plants in SD were significantly shorter than those in other treatments. The flowering of Kalanchoe Lipstick' was not affected by the NIL quality, while Kalanchoe Spain' flowered when grown in SD and 10 molm(-2)s(-1) PPFD NI-B. These results suggest that the NIL quality and intensity affect the morphogenesis and flowering of kalanchoe, and that different cultivars are affected differently. There is a need to further assess the effects of the NIL quality and intensity on the morphogenesis and flowering of short-day plants for practical NIL applications.

AB  - Two separate experiments were conducted to identify suitable cultivars, to optimize light and temperature, and to understand the heading process in order to produce high-quality crisphead lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) in a closed production environment. Three commercial crisphead lettuce cultivars (Adam', Manchu', and Sensation') were grown on deep flow technique beds in a closed-type plant factory under three different fluorescent light intensities [150, 200, and 250 mu molm(-2)s(-1) photosynthetic photon flux (PPF)] and two temperature conditions. The plants were grown until 60days after transplantation (DAT) under the high [22/18 degrees C (0-30 DAT)18/16 degrees C (30-60 DAT)] and low [18/16 degrees C (0-30 DAT)18/14 degrees C (30-60 DAT)] temperature conditions, with 50 +/- 10% relative humidity and a 12-h day length. Growth parameters, including head formation rate and tip burn incidence, were measured in all experiments. All cultivars exhibited significantly higher growth rates in the 250 mu molm(-2)s(-1) light intensity compared to lower light intensities under both temperature conditions, and showed a cultivar-specific difference in the growth pattern at different light intensities. Our cultivation trials suggest that Sensation' is ideal for production in closed-type plant factory systems at 250 mu molm(-2)s(-1) PPF due to its stable head formation and superior head quality. Under the high temperature condition, head formation was only observed in two cultivars, Sensation' and Adam', while all cultivars showed head formation in the low temperature condition. The initiation of head formation began at the 8-10 true-leaf stage around 20 DAT, and then apparent head formation was observed around 30 DAT, followed by an increase of head density until harvest (60 DAT). Tip burn symptoms were observed throughout the experiment, with higher values in the high temperature condition. The results of our study suggest that good head formation can be achieved under high light intensities (200 mu molm(-2)s(-1) PPF) and low temperature [18/16 degrees C (0-30 DAT) 18/14 degrees C (30-60 DAT)] in crisphead lettuce grown in a closed-type plant factory.

AB  - Hydroponic systems in plant factories can be categorized into recirculating or noncirculating systems. In this study, the effects of various commercially available circulation pumps, including a centrifugal magnetic drive pump, a regenerative self-priming pump, and a submersible pump, were experimentally explored. In addition, the effects of an ultraviolet sterilization system on the ion concentrations in nutrient solutions were examined. The concentrations of sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, nitrate, sulfate, and ferric (Fe3+) ions in the nutrient solution were measured. For all three types of pumps, the results indicated that there was no significant effect on the concentrations of ions in the nutrient solution. However, the concentration of Fe3+ ions decreased significantly after the nutrient solution was treated by a ultraviolet sterilization system for 48 hours. In addition, the effects of the three types of pumps on the growth of butterhead lettuce (Lactuca sativa) were examined. The temperature records during the pump circulation tests showed that the nutrient solution temperature of the regenerative self-priming pump increased by 15.5 degrees C (from 20.5 to 36 degrees C), which caused yellow seedling, scorching on the leaves, and browning of the roots. The ion concentration in the nutrient solutions and total fresh weight of butterhead lettuce did not show any noticeable difference between the centrifugal magnetic drive pump and the submersible pump. In this paper, we clarify the cause of the decreasing iron concentration and provide a guideline for selecting the pump for circulating hydroponic systems in plant factories.

AB  - We investigated the effects of the quality of light used for interrupting the night period, termed the night interruption light (NIL), on morphogenesis, flowering, and the expression of photoperiodic genes in chrysanthemum (Dendranthema grandiflorum) cultivar Gaya Yellow', a qualitative short-day (SD) plant. Plants were raised in a closed-type plant factory under white (W) light-emitting diodes (LEDs) providing a light intensity of 180molm(-2)s(-1) photosynthetic photon flux density, under a condition of long-day (LD, 16h light/8h dark), short-day (SD, 10h light/14h dark), or SD with a 4-h night interruption (NI) provided by 10molm(-2)s(-1) PPF green (NI-G), blue (NI-B), red (NI-R), far-red (NI-Fr), or W (NI-W) LEDs. Plants grown in the LD condition were the tallest. The SD, NI-B, and NI-Fr conditions induced flowering. Phytochrome A (phyA) and cryptochrome 1 (cry1) were expressed at high levels in plants in NI-B, NI-Fr, and SD conditions. These results suggest that the NIL quality has significant implications on morphogenesis, flowering, and the expression of photoperiodic genes. Flowering was positively affected by the expression of phyA, cry1, and FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), whereas it was negatively affected by the expression of phyB and anti-florigenic FT/TFL1 (AFT).

AB  - At present, blue-red composite LED light sources used for plant lighting are mainly composed of blue light and red light; the blue light is provided by gallium nitride LED chips, but the full-width at half-maximum (FWHW) is only approximately 25 nm, while the blue light required by plants for photosynthesis is wider. Focusing on this problem, this work reported that a dual emitting phosphor-in-glass plate (Dual-PiGP) was prepared towards a high power and dual broadband emitter, in which BaMgAl10O17:Eu2+ (BAM) and CaAlSiN3:Eu2+ (CASN) provide blue and red emission, respectively. Dual-PiGP exhibited several merits, including a high quantum efficiency of 93.90%, a superior thermal stability (80.1%@150 degrees C of the peak intensity at 25 degrees C), and a dual broad spectrum with a full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of 50 and 106 nm at 446 and 645 nm, respectively. Moreover, a proof-of-concept Dual-PiGP plant lamp for application in indoor plant factories was successfully fabricated with Dual-PiGP and a 385 nm emitting LED chip, yielding blue- (400-500 nm) and red-light (580-780 nm) emission that matches well with the absorption spectrum of chlorophyll. The Dual-PiGP plant lamps were applied indoors to cultivate Italian lettuce, and commercial plant lamps assembled by LED chips were chosen as reference. The cultivation results indicated that the biomass of Italian lettuce was 12.12% greater than those cultivated using commercial plant lamps. Further analysis also certificated that the content of soluble protein and total chlorophyll were also improved. The Dual-PiGP light converter strategy provides an option for next-generation plant growth LEDs.

AB  - Productivity stabilization is a critical issue facing plant factories. As such, researchers have been investigating growth prediction with the overall goal of improving productivity. The projected area of a plant (PA) is usually used for growth prediction, by which the growth of a plant is estimated by observing the overall approximate movement of the plant. To overcome this problem, this study focused on the time-series movement of plant leaves, using optical flow (OF) analysis to acquire this information for a lettuce. OF analysis is an image processing method that extracts the difference between two consecutive frames caused by the movement of the subject. Experiments were carried out at a commercial large-scale plant factory. By using a microcomputer with a camera module placed above the lettuce seedlings, images of 338 seedlings were taken every 20 min over 9 days (from the 6th to the 15th day after sowing). Then, the features of the leaf movement were extracted from the image by calculating the normal-vector in the OF analysis, and these features were applied to machine learning to predict the fresh weight of the lettuce at harvest time (38 days after sowing). The growth prediction model using the features extracted from the OF analysis was found to perform well with a correlation ratio of 0.743. Furthermore, this study also considered a phenotyping system that was capable of automatically analyzing a plant image, which would allow this growth prediction model to be widely used in commercial plant factories.

AB  - Berry fruits are well known to contain large amounts of polyphenol compounds. Among them, flavan-3-ol derivatives are a group of secondary metabolism compounds currently attracting a great deal of attention owing to their health benefits. Not only the fruits, but also the leaves of raspberry plants, are highly esteemed for tea making around the world and are largely used for food. In this report, we discuss the results of our study on the effect of light and temperature on polyphenol accumulation in raspberry leaves. When raspberry was cultivated in a plant factory unit and light intensity, wavelength, and temperature were varied, the amount of total polyphenol increased under blue light. Quantitative determination of (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, procyanidin B4, flavan-3-ol trimer, which are flavan-3-ol derivatives, was carried out using HPLC, whereby we confirmed their increase under blue light. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR showed correlation between chalcone synthase (CHS) gene expression and the amounts of the compounds measured in the leaves.

AB  - Indoor plant cultivation can result in significantly improved resource use efficiency (surface, water, and nutrients) as compared to traditional growing systems, but illumination costs are still high. LEDs (light emitting diodes) are gaining attention for indoor cultivation because of their ability to provide light of different spectra. In the light spectrum, red and blue regions are often considered the major plants' energy sources for photosynthetic CO2 assimilation. This study aims at identifying the role played by red:blue (R:B) ratio on the resource use efficiency of indoor basil cultivation, linking the physiological response to light to changes in yield and nutritional properties. Basil plants were cultivated in growth chambers under five LED light regimens characterized by different R:B ratios ranging from 0.5 to 4 (respectively, RB0.5, Ra-1, RB2, RB3, and RB4), using fluorescent lamps as control (CK1). A photosynthetic photon flux density of 215 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) was provided for 16 h per day. The greatest biomass production was associated with LED lighting as compared with fluorescent lamp. Despite a reduction in both stomatal conductance and PSII quantum efficiency, adoption of RB3 resulted in higher yield and chlorophyll content, leading to improved use efficiency for water and energy. Antioxidant activity followed a spectral-response function, with optimum associated with RB3. A low RB ratio (0.5) reduced the relative content of several volatiles, as compared to CK1 and RB >= 2. Moreover, mineral leaf concentration (g g(-1) DW) and total content in plant (g plant(-1)) were influences by light quality, resulting in greater N, P, K, Ca, Mg, and Fe accumulation in plants cultivated with RB3. Contrarily, nutrient use efficiency was increased in RB <= 1. From this study it can be concluded that a RB ratio of 3 provides optimal growing conditions for indoor cultivation of basil, fostering improved performances in terms of growth, physiological and metabolic functions, and resources use efficiency.

AB  - The growth rate of vegetables in plant factories can be regulated by environmental factors including light, temperature, and chemicals, which might give rise to mutation in leaf health. Here, we aim to devise a new way that allows for controlling the growth rate of plants in hydroponics as well as maintaining the product quality; we apply underwater ultrasound and dissolved oxygen supersaturation as external stimuli to plants. As an example, we examine the growth of leaf lettuce in hydroponics with exposure to 28-kHz ultrasound and dissolved oxygen supersaturation up to 36 mg/L at 20 degrees C. Our results show that exposure to the ultrasound of peak-to-peak pressure at 20 kPa or larger works as the growth inhibitor of the leaves and the roots, while the oxygen supersaturation as the growth promoter, without any degradation of chlorophyll in the leaves. This suggests that these external stimuli can be used in the growth control system of plant factories.

AB  - Controlled environment agriculture (CEA) is a growing industry for the production of leafy vegetables and fresh produce in general. Moreover, CEA is a potentially desirable alternative production system, as well as a risk management solution for the food safety challenges within the fresh produce industry. Here, we will focus on hydroponic leafy vegetable production (including lettuce, spinach, microgreens, and herbs), which can be categorized into six types: (1) nutrient film technique (NFT), (2) deep water raft culture (DWC), (3) flood and drain, (4) continuous drip systems, (5) the wick method, and (6) aeroponics. The first five are the most commonly used in the production of leafy vegetables. Each of these systems may confer different risks and advantages in the production of leafy vegetables. This review aims to (i) address the differences in current hydroponic system designs with respect to human pathogen internalization risk, and (ii) identify the preventive control points for reducing risks related to pathogen contamination in leafy greens and related fresh produce products.

AB  - To explore lighting strategies for crop production in space, we investigated the impacts of light spectrum on morphology, biomass, and phytonutrients of red pak choi (Brassica rapa var. chinensis, 'Ruin F-1') over a 28-day cycle. Light treatments were white light-emitting diodes (WLEDs) as a control, W + red (WR), W + green switched to red at 21 days (WG-R), W + far-red (WFR), red and blue (RB), and an LED-based artificial sunlight research module (ASRM). The photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) was maintained near 180 mu mol m(-2).s(-1) for all light treatments. Our results indicated that red pak choi grown under a narrow spectrum of RB light was most suitable for leaf expansion, biomass yield, and relative anthocyanin accumulation. The various broad-spectrum WLED treatments reduced yield, leaf area, and anthocyanin content. Supplemental G and FR augmented the reduction of growth and phytonutrients, however chlorophyll and anthocyanin levels recovered to levels comparable to the control within 7 days of switching WG to WR. The ASRM was used to assess direct sunlight as an alternative lighting option for plant growth in space. ASRM increased overall yield and specific leaf weight compared to WLED and supplemental treatments, and was similar to plants grown under RB in terms of fresh/dry weight, but lower in phytonutrients. Our results suggest both narrow and broad-band light sources can be used to manipulate morphology, phytonutrients, and partitioning of biomass in red pak choi.

AB  - The measurement of plant growth's light environment is the basis of urban agriculture, such as light-emitting diode plant factories. The photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) sensors, which measure the photon flux density of radiation in the spectral interval from 400 to 700 nm, cannot measure the spectral components, including the photon flux density of red light band and the photon flux density of blue light band, the light in these two bands are widely used in plant lighting. Facility agriculture, especially plant factories with artificial lighting, needs these data and their ratios by far, so a type of multichannel PPFD sensor is designed to solve these problems. First, we expound the design principle, circuit, and structure of the sensor, and calibrate the unregulated sensors by a standard PPFD sensor (PQS-1, Holland) under the calibration device constructed by controller based on DMX512 protocol. The test results show that the sensor's average variance is 0.9956, which approximates the ideal linear response value 1. Meanwhile, we make a black opaque soft plastic anticrosslight sleeve using three-dimensional printing to solve the problem of crosslight on the sidewall of the filter, which let the crosslight error coefficient of the red and blue channels reduced by an order of magnitude and approached 0. Finally, we designed a set of light environment control systems, which can autocontrol the PPFD and light quality ratios, and a set of supplemental lighting systems, which can control the daily light integral, based on the sensors.

AB  - BACKGROUND In recent years, protected crop production using plant factories to produce high-value crops with greater functional components has become more popular in many countries. The quantification of the components, however, is mainly conducted by laboratory analyses, which are both time- and labor-consuming. The present study aimed to investigate the potential of a non-destructive diffuse reflectance spectroscopy technique for estimating functional components (i.e. glucosinolates, amino acids, sugars and carotenoids) in the leaves of Chinese cabbage grown in a plant factory. RESULTS From the overall analysis, better estimations were obtained using the partial least square regression procedure. The important wavelengths for each functional component were identified mainly in the ultraviolet-visible regions. Identified wavelengths were 317, 390, 888 and 940 nm for sugars; 520 and 960 nm for amino acids; 385, 860 and 945 nm for glucosinolates; and 454, 472 and 530 nm for carotenoids. CONCLUSION Optical reflectance spectroscopy shows potential as a tool for the estimation of functional components in the leaves of Chinese cabbage. The results of the present study provide useful information for the design and application of sensors with respect to on-site quantification of the functional components.

AB  - Plant factories have been developed to replace traditional agriculture, aiming to solve future problems of food availability. However, the nutrient solution in a plant factory is discharged after a single batch of plant cultivation, giving rise to large amounts of waste nutrient solution. Microalgae can be used to treat a wide variety of wastewater and effectively remove excessive nutrients from wastewater. Therefore, the incorporation of microalgal cultivation into a plant factory to treat waste nutrients would be a reasonable approach facilitating removal of waste nutrients with concomitant production of algal biomass. In this study, we isolated novel microalgal species suitable for the growth in waste nutrients from a plant factory and subsequently an underwater LED photobioreactor was constructed being incorporated into the plant factory system. Finally, treated waste nutrient solution was recycled back into the plant factory and successfully used for the cultivation of plant of butterhead lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.).

AB  - This research evaluated the influence of light intensity and quality in the concentration of antioxidant compounds during the production cycle of cultivated romaine lettuce under a plant-factory system. Three treatments were tested: T1 = 127.49 (red and blue), T2 = 147.32 (red and blue) and T3 = 235.69 (red, blue and supplemented white light) mu mol/m(2)/s, respectively. The recorded variables were total concentration of phenols (TP), flavonoids (TF), non-flavonoid compounds (TNF), as well as antioxidant capacity by DPPH and ABTS assays. Results showed significant statistical differences among treatments and sampling events: T2 caused the highest concentration in all the variables. The concentration of antioxidant compounds in T1 and T3 was statistically equal (p <= 0.05). The content of total phenolics, total flavonoids and total non-flavonoids evaluated in romaine lettuce depend mainly on the incident light spectra (red and blue), which allows promotion of a significant increase (p <= 0.05) in concentration of 34.9, 47.9 and 29.2 %, respectively. Additionally, the red and blue light spectra in a to 3:1 ratio increase the concentration of phenolic compounds, as well as their antioxidant capacity (p <= 0.05).

AB  - Lighting systems based on light-emitting diodes (LED) are currently considered promising sources of main and additional plant lighting in protected ground facilities (PGF): In greenhsouses, plant factories, city farms. At the same time, application of LEDs is still limited by lack of information on the most efficient methods of crop lighting and selection of methods of optimisation of crop lighting modes inside PGF. This paper briefly describes plant responses to different modes of LED lighting, provides examples of application of LED-based plant emitters in PGF and provides some approaches to optimisation of the additional LED lighting mode and the model of crop production process. It is shown that multi-factor vegetation experiments with further regression analysis of obtained data may be a useful method of optimisation of LED lighting in photoculture environment. An adaptive search system of control of a red-white LED emitter for a phytotron with Chinese cabbage crop is described. The data on age drift of photosynthetic productivity of Chinese cabbage is provided and the trend of the peak of the selected optimisation criterion in the course of vegetation in the LED lighting adaptive optimisation system is shown.

AB  - Vertical farming is of major interest in research and development to enable the production of food in the quantity sufficient for the growing world population under the weather conditions, which are increasingly becoming more and more extreme. Especially in cities, vertical farming allows for growing vegetables and other plants locally. Apart from industrial applications of vertical farming, new ideas are being developed to make cities "greener", often related to the maker culture. In the study, we concentrated on the second approach by investigating the possibilities to grow plants on textile fabrics placed vertically, e.g. along a balcony railing, but also as structural elements in agricultural areas. Our investigations revealed, using the example of cress, that steadily irrigated knitted fabrics enable plant growth on them, indicating no significant differences between differently knitted stitch dimensions and different illumination intensities. Finally, we discuss the possibilities to measure the time-resolved plant growth reliably and suggest additional possibilities to evaluate the growth success.

AB  - Introduction - Blueberry harvest season is only from June to September in japan. Developing new cultivation methods for year-round blueberry production is desired to reduce off-season blueberry imports at a high price. Consulting with previous studies about influences of environmental factors on plants, the current study was carried out to investigate flowering characteristics, plant morphology, and potential for year-round high quality blueberry production under different light quality in a plant factory. Materials and methods - Blueberry plants cvs. 'Misty' and 'Sharpblue' were grown in light emitting diodes (LED) chambers installed with LED of 100% blue (459 nm), 100% red (631 nm), a mixture of 1:1 = red:blue light (a mixture of LED lights). Fluorescent light was used as control. Results and discussion - Cumulative flower number was maximum in 'Misty' under blue LED light and in 'Sharpblue under a mixture of LED lights. In Sharpblue, red LED light encouraged vegetative growth, and plants under blue light were delayed in growth with cessation of shoot elongation. However, a mixture of LED lights and fluorescent ones showed desirable vegetative growth and high potential for continuous flowering. In terms of fruit quality, higher soluble solid content (SSC) and less titratable acidity (TA) were found in fruits under blue LED light and a mixture of LED lights. Bigger fruits were found in plants under a mixture of LED lights and control but comparatively less SSC was found under control. Conclusion - Light quality has been shown to have a strong influence on flowering characteristics, plant morphology, and year-round high quality blueberry production in a plant factory.

AB  - Vertical farming is one of several ideas that are being developed further by diverse research groups, companies and private citizens. Due to the growing problems of urbanisation and a growing population, vertical farming has presented itself as one possibility to feed people, particularly in large and densely crowded cities, in an efficient and eco-friendly way. Interestingly, while agrotextiles are often used in agriculture and textile fabrics can be bought, for example, as frames for small vertical farming solutions for private balconies, only a few researchers have studied the possibilities of using textile fabrics as substrates for vertical faming to date. This study provides an overview of possible future applications of textile fabrics in vertical farming solutions.

AB  - Agricultural production in controlled environments is increasingly feasible, and may play an important role in providing nutrition and choice to growing urban centres. New technologies in lighting, ventilation, robotics and irrigation are just a few of the innovations that enable production of high-value specialty crops outside of a traditional field setting. However, despite all of the advances in the hardware within the plant factory operation, innovation of the most complex machine has been neglected - the plant itself. Indoor agricultural operations typically rely on legacy varieties, plants selected and bred for field conditions. In the field, phenotypic stability is paramount, as production must be consistent in an unpredictable and changing environment. However, the controlled environment affords focus on different breeding priorities as environmental flux, pests, pathogens and post-harvest quality are less formidable barriers to production. On the contrary, breeding for controlled environments shifts the focus to a completely different set of plant traits, such as rapid growth, performance in low light environments and active manipulation of plant stature. Instead of breeding for phenotypic stability, plants may be bred to maximise genetic plasticity, allowing specific traits to be presented as a function of the quality of the ambient light spectrum. In this scenario plant varieties may be grown with optimal size, supporting a focus on consumer traits like flavour or accumulation of health-related compounds. Gene editing may be a central technology in the production of designer plants for controlled environments. This review considers the opportunity for breeding for controlled environments, with a focus on a revision of priorities for controlled-environment breeders.

AB  - In recent decades, there has been a gradual penetration of plant factories achieving semiautomated crop cultivation. However, efficient energy utilization, as well as quality control of crops, are very important factors with regard to sustainable operation. Operating parameters, such as room temperature, affect not only the quality of crops but also the electric power required to realize the target operation while being influenced by the environment outside the plant. Therefore, a methodology is needed to analyze and interpret the relationships among these manipulated variables, exogenous variables, crop quality, and the amount of required electric power. Constructing a directed acyclic graph composed of regression models is an attractive approach for such analysis; however, the relationships can possibly be nonlinear, so the direct application of existing analytic approaches will not be appropriate. In this paper, we propose a methodology for relationship analysis among variables based on the directed acyclic graphs while identifying the linearity/nonlinearity in their relationships. In general, the construction of such a graphical model has computational issues, especially when the number of variables is large, and the risk of over fitting. The proposed method utilizes the idea of sparse regularization, which has been actively discussed in the field of machine learning, for realizing the automatic identification of linearity/nonlinearity between variables and screening redundant candidate structures; this approach relaxes the computational complexity issue and controls the risk of overfitting. As a case study, the proposed method is applied to a dataset collected from a real-world cultivation system in a plant factory to discuss its usefulness.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of light of different wavelengths on the growth and quality of daughter cladodes in the edible cactus Nopalea cochenillifera. Mother cladodes were cultivated under a deep-flow hydroponic culture system and irradiated with red or blue light alone or in combination (in the ratio 1:3 or 3:1) in an enclosed-type plant factory. Daughter cladodes developed from mother cladodes in all treatments. The rate of elongation of first cladodes was lower under blue light and the combination of red and blue light (in the ratio 1:3) compared with other treatments. The number of daughter cladodes was also low under blue light. Thus, compared with red light, blue light appears to suppress daughter cladode development. However, the width of daughter cladodes was higher under blue light and the combination of red and blue light (in the ratio 1:3) compared with other treatments. Total fresh weight (FW) of daughter cladodes emerging from one mother cladode was lowest under blue light and high under combined red and blue light (1:3 and 3:1). The number of spines, an undesirable characteristic of edible cacti, was significantly higher under both combinations of red and blue light (1:3 and 3:1) compared to other treatments. On the other hand, the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity of extracts of the daughter cladodes was highest under blue light or under combined red and blue light (1:3). Our results show that light wavelength strongly affects daughter cladode growth and development. Thus, controlling the lighting environment is effective for improving growth and quality in edible cacti.

AB  - The goal of this study was to determine the effects of various visible light spectra on the growth and bioactive compounds of ice plant (Mesembryanthemum crystallinum L.) in a plant factory with artificial light. Three-week-old seedlings were transplanted into subirrigation systems in a plant factory (average of 23 degrees C air temperature, 60% relative humidity, 170 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1) photosynthetic photon flux density, 12 h photoperiod, and 1,000 mu mol.mol(-1) CO2) equipped with fluorescent lamps (FL, control); monochromatic red (R, 654 nm), green (G, 518 nm), and blue (B, 455 nm) light-emitting diodes (LEDs); and various combinations of R and B (R:B = 6:4, 7:3, 8:2, 9:1), or RB with G (R:G:B = 5:1:4, 6:1:3, 7:1:2, 8:1:1, 9:1:0) LEDs. Shoot fresh weight was higher in the R8B2, R7B3, and R8G1B1 treatments, but did not significantly differ from that in the control. Root fresh weight was highest in the R8G1B1 treatment among all treatments. Leaf area showed a similar trend to shoot fresh weight. The specific leaf weight increased as the ratio of B LEDs increased under the RB and RGB treatments, except in the R8G1B1 treatment. Plants in the RGB treatments with 5 - 6% G light had a higher photosynthetic rate when compared with the RB treatments. The total phenolic content based on unit grams in plants irradiated with RB and RGB LEDs did not show a significant difference except in the R9G1B0 treatment. Antioxidant capacity per unit dry weight tended to increase as the ratio of B LEDs increased in the RB treatments. Regarding total phenolic content and antioxidant capacity per plant, the highest values were recorded in treatments R8B2, R7B3, and R8G1B1, which was similar to the shoot growth results. These results indicate that LEDs with R8B2, R7B3, and R8G1B1 ratios, as well as FL, are suitable visible lighting sources for producing high-value ice plants in plant factories.

AB  - In this report, we have investigated the influence of different light qualities on Digitalis purpurea under a controlled environment. For this purpose, red (R), blue (B), fluorescent lamp (FL, control), along with combined red and blue (R: B) LEDs were used. Interestingly, the plant growth parameters such as number of leaf, longest root, width of leaf, width of stomata, width of trichome, leaf area, leaf or root fresh weight (FW), weight (DW) as well as length of trichome were maximum under R:B (8:2), and significantly larger than control plants. The stomatal conductance or anthocyanin was maximum under B LED than those under FL, however the photosynthesis rate was greater under FL. RuBisCO activity was maximum under R:B (1:1) LEDs while the quantity of the UV absorbing substances was highest under R LED than under FL. The maximum amount of cardenolides were obtained from leaf tissue under R:B (2:8) LED than those under FL. The R:B LEDs light was suitable for Digitalis plant growth, development, micro- and macro-elements, as well as cardenolides accumulation in the plant factory system. The adaptation of the growth strategy developed in this study would be useful for the production of optimized secondary metabolites in Digitalis spp.

AB  - Red leaf lettuce (Lactuca sativa) has high nutritional value and is frequently used in salads. In a plant factory with full electric lighting, if the spectrum is incorrect, then red leaf lettuce will have incomplete coloration. This study aimed to establish a light recipe for the mass production of red leaf lettuce using electric light sources in a plant factory by using indicators for quantitative assessment, including energy yield (EY) [grams of fresh weight (FW) harvested per kilowatt hour of electricity input for lighting], photon yield (PY) (grams of FW harvested per mole of photons delivered), anthocyanin yield per kilowatt hour (EYA), and anthocyanin yield per photon (PYA). First, the effects of four types of light quality on FW and anthocyanin content were examined. Then, two types of light quality, light-emitting diode with a red-to-blue photon ratio of 80:20 (R-80:B-20) and R-20:B-80, were selected for an experiment involving five treatments. An optimum light recipe (SR5SB1) including R-80:B-20 treatment during the early stage of cultivation (weeks 1 through 5 after sowing) followed by R-20:B-80 treatment during the final stage (week 6) was proposed. The SR5SB1 treatment led to FW, EYA, and PYA of 87.8 g/plant, 1.63 mg/kWh, and 0.57 mg.mol(-1), respectively. This treatment resulted in the highest EYA and PYA, with 159% and 256% more anthocyanin productivity, respectively, compared with cool white treatment (with FW, EYA, and PYA of 65.8 g/plant, 0.63 mg/kWh, and 0.16 mg.mol(-1), respectively). The proposed SR5SB1 light recipe enabled cultivation of red leaf lettuce with a balanced yield and anthocyanin production.

AB  - Internal variations and external disturbances often adversely influence normal operation of plant factories and their production stability. In this research, a salad-cultivating plant factory (abbreviated as SPF) was considered as a dissipative system, its highly valid kinetic model was developed using system dynamics and experimental data. Optimal closed-loop control law of light intensity, temperature and aerating rate was then obtained based on the gradient of stored-energy (Lyapunov) function of the SPF derived from Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs equation. Both digital and real-time simulation results showed that the SPF closed-loop control system with optimal control law could continuously dissipate the stored energy, namely internal variation and external disturbances resulting from insect and microbial damage and other environmental fluctuations with different strengths to stabilize the SPF at an operating point and maintaining the good yield of salad with desired dynamic response characteristics to control actions. This research will lay a theoretical and method foundation for construction and operation of facility agricultural systems and closed artificial ecosystems.

AB  - Plant factories with artificial lighting have been developed to improve food production, functional ingredients, and profitability. Intensive research has been performed to elucidate the effects of light intensity and wavelength on plant growth and nutritional quality with the use of light-emitting diodes (LEDs). In particular, the effects of monochromatic red, blue, or simultaneous red + blue light have been studied because these wavelengths are predominantly used for photosynthesis. We examined the effects of alternating red and blue light provided by LEDs over a period of 24 hours on the growth and nutritional properties of leafy lettuce. The results clearly show that alternating red and blue light accelerated plant growth significantly compared with white fluorescent lamps or red and blue LEDs at the same daily light integral. Plants grown under alternating red/blue light had a greater net assimilation rate and total and projected leaf area (an indicator of the fraction of leaf area that absorbs more light) than other plants. Additionally, alternating red and blue light maintained high concentrations of sugars, ascorbic acid, and anthocyanins in leaves. Taken together, the results indicate that continuous irradiation with alternating red and blue light could enhance growth while maintaining the nutritional quality in lettuce.

AB  - Plasma lighting systems have been engineered to simulate sunlight. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of plasma lighting on tomato plant growth, photosynthetic characteristics, flowering rate, and physiological disorders. Tomato plants were grown in growth chambers at air temperatures of 25/23 degrees C (light/dark period), in a 16hday(-1) light period provided by four different light sources: 1kW and 700W sulfur plasma lights (1 SPL and 0.7 SPL), 1kW indium bromide plasma light, and 700W high pressure sodium lamp (0.7 HPS) as a control. The total dry weight and leaf area at 0.7 SPL were approximately 1.2 and 1.3 times greater, respectively, than that of 0.7 HPS at the 62days after sowing (DAS). The maximum light assimilation rate was observed at 1 SPL at the 73 DAS. In addition, the light compensation and saturation points of the plants treated with plasma lighting were 98.5% higher compared with HPS. Those differences appeared to be related to more efficient light interception, provided by the SPL spectrum. The percentage of flowering at 0.7 SPL was 30.5%, which was higher than that at 0.7 HPS; however, there were some instances of severe blossom end rot. Results indicate that plasma lighting promotes tomato growth, flowering, and photosynthesis. Therefore, a plasma lighting system may be a valuable supplemental light source in a greenhouse or plant factory.

AB  - The issue of food security has affected the well-being of the people for centuries. Academic and industry experts have been constantly developing alternate and better ways to address this issue. One of such innovations is the concept of vertical and zero acreage farming for providing food security and ensuring environmental sustainability. However, this concept has been in its nascent stage, and its development has been sporadic for many years. This paper uses a comprehensive framework to conduct a feasibility analysis of initiating vertical farming on university campuses, which could set an example for using this technique on a large scale. A case study was conducted on a set of 24 canteens across a university in Wuhan, China for accessing the return on investment and food sufficiency using this technique. By using the central limit theorem, a model was developed after investing in 24 canteens in the university, and various scenarios were analyzed. The breakeven on implementing these farms was about 10 to 20 years, with annual profits reaching $92,000 (592,000 RMB).

AB  - As indoor horticulture gathers momentum, electric (also termed artificial) lighting systems with the ability to generate specific and tunable wavelengths have been developed and applied. While the effects of light quality on plant growth and development have been studied, authoritative and reliable sets of light formulae tailored for the cultivation of economically important plants and plant traits are lacking as light qualities employed across laboratories are inconsistent. This is due, at least in part, to the lack of molecular data for plants examined under electric lights in indoor environments. It has hampered progress in the field of indoor horticulture, in particular, the transition from small-scale indoor farming to commercial plant factories. Here, we review the effects of light quality on model and crop plants studied from a physiological, physical and biochemical perspective, and explain how functional genomics can be employed in tandem to generate a wealth of molecular data specific for plants cultivated under indoor lighting. We also review the current state of lighting technologies in indoor horticulture specifically discussing how recent narrow-bandwidth lighting technologies can be tailored to cultivate economically valuable plant species and traits. Knowledge gained from a complementary phenotypic and functional genomics approach can be harvested not only for economical gains but also for sustainable food production. We believe that this review serves as a platform that guides future light-related plant research.

AB  - High-energy ultraviolet (UV) light is an environmental stress that can be used to stimulate the biosynthesis of bioactive compounds in plants. This study aimed to comparatively determine the effects of UV-A, UV-B, and UV-Clamps or light-emitting diodes (LEDs) on the growth of dropwort (Oenanthe stolonifera) plants, and their contents of bioactive compounds. Dropwort seedlings with 2-3 offshoots were transplanted in a plant factory equipped with white LED and deep flow technique systems, and cultivated under standard growth conditions for 36days. Thereafter, the dropwort plants were supplementally exposed to one of five UV treatments with energy equivalent to 10Wm(-2): UV-C lamps for 2days, UV-B lamps for 3days, and UV-A lamps and LEDs with 370nm or 385nm peak wavelengths for 14days. The variable fluorescence (Fv) to maximum fluorescence (Fm) ratio (Fv/Fm) of dropwort leaves began to significantly decrease 3h after exposure to UV-C, and 6h after UV-B exposure. Fluorescence in UV-C and UV-B-treated plants was lower than in control and UV-A-treated plants during the entire period of UV irradiation. The fresh weight of the shoots of plants treated with UV was not significantly different to those of the control plants during the entire UV irradiation period. The total phenolic content of dropwort shoots exposed to UV-A and UV-B treatments significantly increased compared to that of the control 1day after treatment. The total phenolic content was highest in plants treated with the 370nm UV-A LED, and this was significantly higher (33%) than the control. Plants treated with the 385nm UV-A LED on day 3 of treatment had the highest total phenolic content compared to the other treatments. A similar trend was observed in contents of flavonoids and persicarin. UVlight induced higher anthocyanin content than the control. The activity of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase after UV treatments was significantly higher than the control, supporting the findings of our bioactive compound assays. In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that irradiating vegetables with UV-A LEDs would be useful in plant factories with artificial light for improving vegetable quality without inhibiting growth.

AB  - Currently, global warming is worsening, causing the difficulty of cultivating crops in open fields, and leading to unstable quality of crops. Plant factories provide a well-controlled growth environment for precisely cultivating plants. However, uneven temperature distributions (UTDs) still occur at each cultivation shelf in plant factories, which decreases the yields (fresh weight) of plants. In this study, a wireless sensor network (WSN)-based automatic temperature monitoring and fan-circulating system for precision cultivation in plant factories is proposed, and it is built upon the technologies of WSN, ordinary kriging spatial interpolation, and automation control, to precisely find the UTD areas of cultivation shelves. Once a UTD area occurs, the fan-circulating system can be triggered immediately to automatically trace the area and circulate the air. This action can effectively improve the air flow in the cultivation zone, providing optimal growth conditions for plants. The proposed system has been deployed in two plant factories that grew Boston lettuces, and a series of performance evaluation experiments were conducted. The experimental results indicate that the fresh weight of the harvested lettuces increases by 61-109% when employing the proposed system that efficiently and significantly decreases the variation of the temperature in the cultivation zone.

AB  - To examine growth conditions that can increase the critical dietary mineral zinc in leaves of baby leaf red oak lettuce, we investigated zinc accumulation under various conditions, including different zinc concentrations in nutrient solution, wind speeds, and root zone temperatures. A high zinc concentration in the nutrient solution led to greatly increased leaf zinc concentration, but also decreased fresh and dry weights of shoots. In addition, necrosis was observed in leaves at a zinc concentration in the nutrient solution of >= 0.15 mM. By contrast, high wind speed and root zone temperature led to increases in leaf zinc concentration, but slightly decreased fresh and dry weights of shoots. In addition, under high wind speed and root zone temperature, no leaf necrosis was observed. The increase in leaf zinc concentration was attributed to increases in zinc absorption, accompanied by increased transpiration, because water absorption rates increased with wind speed and root zone temperature. Therefore, baby leaf red oak lettuce with high leaf zinc concentration can be produced by increasing wind speed and root zone temperature.

AB  - The production of food crops in controlled environment agriculture (CEA) can help mitigate food insecurity that may result from increasingly frequent and severe weather events in agricultural areas. Lighting is an absolute requirement for crop growth in CEA, and is undergoing rapid advances with the advent of tunable, light emitting diode (LED) systems. The integration of these systems into existing CEA environmental control architectures is in its infancy and would benefit from a non-invasive, rapid, real-time, remote sensor that could track crop growth under different lighting regimes. A newly-developed remote chlorophyll a fluorescence (ChlF) sensing device is described herein that provides direct, remote, real-time physiological data collection for integration into tunable LED lighting control systems, thereby enabling better control of crop growth and energy efficiency. Data collected by this device can be used to accurately model growth of red lettuce plants. In addition to monitoring growth, this system can predict relative growth rates (RGR), net assimilation rates (NAR), plant area (PA), and leaf area ratio (LAR).

AB  - Threats to global food security have generated the need for novel food production techniques to feed an ever-expanding population with ever-declining land resources. Hydroponic cultivation has been long recognised as a reliable, resilient and resource-use-efficient alternative to soil-based agricultural practices. The aspiration for highly efficient systems and even city-based vertical farms is starting to become realised using innovations such as aeroponics and LED lighting technology. However, the ultimate challenge for any crop production system is to be able to operate and help sustain human life in remote and extreme locations, including the polar regions on Earth, and in space. Here we explore past research and crop growth in such remote areas, and the scope to improve on the systems used in these areas to date. We introduce biointensive agricultural systems and 3D growing environments, intercropping in hydroponics and the production of multiple crops from single growth systems. To reflect the flexibility and adaptability of these approaches to different environments we have called this type of enclosed system 'pop-up agriculture'. The vision here is built on sustainability, maximising yield from the smallest growing footprint, adopting the principles of a circular economy, using local resources and eliminating waste. We explore plant companions in intercropping systems to supply a diversity of plant foods. We argue that it is time to consume all edible components of plants grown, highlighting that nutritious plant parts are often wasted that could provide vitamins and antioxidants. Supporting human life via crop production in remote and isolated communities necessitates new levels of efficiency, eliminating waste, minimising environmental impacts and trying to wean away from our dependence on fossil fuels. This aligns well with tandem research emerging from economically developing countries where lower technology hydroponic approaches are being trialled reinforcing the need for 'cross-pollination' of ideas and research development on pop-up agriculture that will see benefits across a range of environments.

AB  - The number of plant factories in which crops are cultivated in an artificial environment has been increasing every year. In cultivation techniques involving hydroponics, plants are supplied with a circulating nutrient solution, which can become contaminated by pathogens that can propagate and spread throughout plant factories. Therefore, strategies to disinfect hydroponic nutrient solutions are needed. In this study, we developed a new disinfection device equipped with an ultraviolet A (UVA) light emitting diode (LED) that can be used to disinfect hydroponic nutrient solutions in plant factories. We first evaluated the basic disinfection capability of the device and then estimated its bactericidal effect in a small scale model system. The log survival ratio was related to UVA irradiation fluence and the volume of nutrient solution. From the assay results, we devised a kinetics equation to describe the relationship between nutrient solution volume, log survival ratio, and UVA fluence. Together our results show that UVA irradiation could be used to disinfect hydroponic nutrient solutions, and the derived kinetics equations can be used to determine optimal conditions, such as nutrient solution volume, UVA irradiation, and killing activity, to develop devices that disinfect hydroponic nutrient solutions.

AB  - For more plant species to be suitable for plant factory production, their optimal light regimes need to be optimized. We evaluated the effects of light quality, light intensity, and photoperiod on the growth and yield of cherry radish grown under red plus blue LEDs in a controlled environment. Radish plants were cultivated under two light qualities with different red:blue ratios (1R:1B, 2R:1B) at three light intensities (180, 240, 300 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) or two photoperiods (12 h/12 h, 16 h/8 h), respectively. The light quality 2R:1B increased root diameter, root volume, and the biomass of shoot and root compared to light quality 1R:1B under a light intensity of 240 and 300 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), but the growth differences between 1R:1B and 2R:1B were significant when the light intensity was 240 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). New leaf chlorophyll content, root growth indices and the root-shoot ratio increased with light intensity. Cherry radish only formed storage roots with commercial value when light intensity was equal to or over 240 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). The root diameter, root volume, root-shoot ratio, and the biomass of shoot and root of plants grown in the 2R:1B treatment was significantly higher than those in the 1R:1B treatment under the 16 h/8 h photoperiod. However, no significant difference was observed in the 12 h/12 h photoperiod. These results indicated that light regime in combination with a light intensity between 240 and 300 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), the light quality 2R:1B, and a 16 h/8 h photoperiod produced appropriate growth of cherry radish in plant factory settings using an LED light source. In conclusion, the production of commercial storage roots in cherry radish is primarily dependent on light intensity, followed by light quality and photoperiod. Furthermore, the effectiveness of light quality regulation of storage roots was highly depended on light intensity and photoperiod.

AB  - Using a light-emitting diode (LED) as the light source, the effects of eight different light treatments [white light (control, W), purple light (P), blue light (B), red light (R), green light (G), yellow light (Y), red-blue light in a 9:1 ratio (9R/1B), and red-blue light in a 4:1 ratio (4R/1B)] on the growth, quality and nitrogen metabolism of lettuce were studied. The results showed that compared with the white light, the purple light, blue light, red light, and the red-blue light combination could all increase the biomass of the aboveground part of lettuce to various degrees, while green light and yellow light inhibited lettuce growth. Under blue light, the contents of soluble protein and flavonoid in lettuce were the highest; under red light, the soluble sugar content was the highest, while the contents of soluble protein, free amino acids, and vitamin C (VC) were relatively higher under the 4R/1B light condition. Compared with white light, the sources of purple, blue, and red lights as well as the red-blue light combination all significantly reduced nitrate accumulation in lettuce, and the activities of the nitrogen (N) metabolism-related enzymes such as nitrate reductase, nitrite reductase, glutamine synthetase, glutamate synthase, and glutamate dehydrogenase were increased to varying degrees. In contrast, the contents of nitrate and ammonium N were significantly accumulated in lettuce under green light, and the activities of relative enzymes were significantly reduced. Therefore, the purple light, blue light, and red-blue combination light sources could promote N assimilation and improve the aboveground biomass accumulation in lettuce by improving the activity of the N metabolism-related enzymes in lettuce. Particularly under the 4R/1B light source, the biomass, soluble protein, VC, and total amino acid content were rather high in lettuce, which indicated that the 4R/1B light source could better effectively improve the nutritional quality and promote the growth of lettuce, while yellow light and green light are not suitable to serve as direct sources in a plant factory. These results provide a certain theoretical basis for the regulation of the light environment in cultivation facilities.

AB  - BACKGROUNDGlucosinolate in Chinese cabbage (Brassica campestris L. ssp. pekinensis (Lour.) Rupr) has potential benefits for human health, and its content is affected by growth conditions. In this study, we used a statistical model to identify the relationship between glucosinolate content and growth conditions, and to predict glucosinolate content in Chinese cabbage.
   RESULTMultiple regression analysis was employed to develop the model's growth condition parameters of growing period, temperature, humidity and glucosinolate content measured in Chinese cabbage grown in a plant factory. The developed model was represented by a second-order multi-polynomial equation with two independent parameters: growth duration and temperature (adjusted R-2=0.81), and accurately predicted glucosinolate content after 14days of seeding.
   CONCLUSIONTo our knowledge, this study presents the first statistical model for evaluating glucosinolate content, suggesting a useful methodology for designing glucosinolate-related experiments, and optimizing glucosinolate content in Chinese cabbage cultivation.

AB  - To reduce nitrate concentrations in vegetables grown under artificial lighting, we determined nitrate accumulation under various conditions of nitrate availability. Butterhead lettuce plants were grown with nutrient solutions of various concentrations, which were maintained according to electrical conductivity (EC) throughout the cultivation period. Under these conditions, growth in nutrient solutions with lower EC led to slight decreases in nitrate concentrations in leaves, but also decreased fresh and dry weights of shoots, leading to the risk of a yield loss under EC control management (ECM). By contrast, when total nitrate requirement was supplied only at the start of cultivation, nitrate concentrations in leaves were decreased significantly with only slightly reduced plant growth. Hence, marketable-sized butterhead lettuces with lower nitrate concentrations can be produced by supplying total nitrate requirements in the nutrient solution at the start of cultivation.

AB  - Vegetables produce metabolites that affect their taste and nutritional value and compounds that contribute to human health. The quality of vegetables grown in plant factories under hydroponic cultivation, e.g., their sweetness and softness, can be improved by controlling growth factors including the temperature, humidity, light source, and fertilizer. However, soil is cheaper than hydroponic cultivation and the visual phenotype of vegetables grown under the two conditions is different. As it is not clear whether their metabolite composition is also different, we studied leaf lettuce raised under the hydroponic condition in practical plant factory and strictly controlled soil condition. We chose two representative cultivars, "black rose" (BR) and "red fire" (RF) because they are of high economic value. Metabolite profiling by comprehensive gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) resulted in the annotation of 101 metabolites from 223 peaks detected by GC-MS; LC-MS yielded 95 peaks. The principal component analysis (PCA) scatter plot showed that the most distinct separation patterns on the first principal component (PC1) coincided with differences in the cultivation methods. There were no clear separations related to cultivar differences in the plot. PC1 loading revealed the discriminant metabolites for each cultivation method. The level of amino acids such as lysine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and valine was significantly increased in hydroponically grown leaf lettuce, while soil-cultivation derived leaf lettuce samples contained significantly higher levels of fatty-acid derived alcohols (tetracosanol and hexacosanol) and lettuce-specific sesquiterpene lactones (lactucopicrin-15-oxalate and 15-deoxylactucin-8-sulfate). These findings suggest that the metabolite composition of leaf lettuce is primarily affected by its cultivation condition. As the discriminant metabolites reveal important factors that contribute to the nutritional value and taste characteristics of leaf lettuce, we performed comprehensive metabolite profiling to identify metabolite compositions, i.e., metabolite signature, that directly improve its quality and value.

AB  - Climate screens are typically used inside glass greenhouses to improve control of humidity and temperature, and thus reduce energy expenditure. Shade nets are more appropriate to use, either with or without polyethylene cladding, at locations less-reliant on climate control, but where protection against hail, wind and excessive solar radiation might be needed. In addition, insect screens and nets can be employed to hinder insect pests and other invertebrates entering either type of production environment, and to keep invertebrates used in pest management contained inside. Screens and nets both transmit sunlight in a wave-length-specific manner, giving them the potential to affect plant morphology and physiology. Screens and nets of various colours and nominal shading factors have been described and studied; however, detailed measurements of their spectral characteristics are scarce. We measured solar spectral photon-irradiance and its attenuation by climate screens, shade nets, insect nets, greenhouse glass, and polyethylene covers. Our aim was to elucidate the effects of different patterns, colours, and shading factors, on light quality in production environments. Our measurements reveal that there are large differences both in the fraction of global irradiance attenuated and spectral ratios received under materials that are otherwise superficially similar in terms of their appearance and texture. We suggest that the type of spectral characterization that we performed is required to fully interpret the results of research examining plant responses to different types of screen and net. These data on spectral irradiance would benefit material manufacturers, researchers, growers, and horticultural consultants, enabling material selection to better match the solutions sought by growers and their desired outcomes regarding plant performance.

AB  - Spectral composition of artificial light is an important environmental factor for plants cultivated in controllable environment, eg., plant factory. In an attempt to explore the influence of different spectral wavebands on leaf lettuce growth and development, a new way of light treatment with turning off the specific narrow-wavebands from the wide spectrum was established. And leaf lettuce was cultivated under different light spectra with the spectral wavebands of green (LG), yellow (LY) and purple (LP) "knockout" respectively in controllable environment. Then changes in biomass, morphological indexes, photosynthetic gas exchange, chlorophyll content and soluble sugar content of lettuce were examined. Our results revealed that, compared with plants grown under wide-spectral LED light (CK), LG treatment showed significantly reduction of fresh shoot weight at 25 days after planting (DAP) comparing to CK. LY and LP obtained obviously higher fresh shoot weight and moisture content at 15 DAP, in contrast, significantly lower ratio of root to shoot than CK. And A/Ci in LG were significantly reduced by about 33.3% and 36.1% at 20 DAP and 25 DAP respectively compared with CK. In addition, LY showed significant increases in soluble sugar content compared to other treatments at three sampling stages, while the lowest values were obtained in CK. These results indicated that green, yellow and purple light had significant regulations on the biomass, photosynthesis and soluble sugar content in lettuce, depending on the different growth period.

AB  - A comprehensive analysis of multiple aspects of food production is needed to address related concerns, such as the use of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizers, the consumption of water, the occupation or transformation of land, and greenhouse gas emissions. We examine the environmental properties of plant factories with sunlight and plant factories with artificial light, comparing them with conventional Japanese horticulture systems. Process conditions and inventory data were extracted from demonstration factories in Chiba, Japan. We found that these plant factories reduced the use of irreplaceable resources for food production, i.e., phosphorus, water, and land area, at the expense of additional energy consumption compared with conventional Japanese horticulture systems. By employing emerging energy technology options, energy consumption can be reduced sufficiently to be competitive with that of conventional horticulture systems. The results indicate that plant factories could become a viable or competitive production technology, changing the slope factors in the nexus of food, energy, and water systems.

AB  - Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are an artificial light source used in closed-type plant factories and provide a promising solution for a year-round supply of green leafy vegetables, such as lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.). Obtaining high-quality seedlings using controlled irradiation from LEDs is critical, as the seedling health affects the growth and yield of leaf lettuce after transplantation. Because key molecular pathways underlying plant responses to a specific light quality and intensity remain poorly characterised, we used a multi-omics-based approach to evaluate the metabolic and transcriptional reprogramming of leaf lettuce seedlings grown under narrow-band LED lighting. Four types of monochromatic LEDs (one blue, two green and one red) and white fluorescent light (control) were used at low and high intensities (100 and 300 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1), respectively). Multi-platform mass spectrometry-based metabolomics and RNA-Seq were used to determine changes in the metabolome and transcriptome of lettuce plants in response to different light qualities and intensities. Metabolic pathway analysis revealed distinct regulatory mechanisms involved in flavonoid and phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathways under blue and green wavelengths. Taken together, these data suggest that the energy transmitted by green light is effective in creating a balance between biomass production and the production of secondary metabolites involved in plant defence.

AB  - Light-emitting diode (LED) technology has rapidly advanced the past years and it is nowadays irrevocably linked with controlled-environment agriculture (CEA). We provide here an amalgamation of the recent research achievements in the horticulture and floriculture industry, ranging from greenhouse applications to climate rooms and vertical farming. We hope this overview bestows ample examples for researchers and growers in the selection of the appropriate LED light solution for amending crop yield, phytochemical content, nutritional value, flowering control, transplant success, pre-harvest and postharvest product quality, and production of regeneration material. We leave the reader with some future prospects and directions that need to be taken into account in this ever-growing field.

AB  - With the current global food production capability, it is not difficult to anticipate that there will be a global food shortage when the world population grows beyond 10billion by the end of the 21st century. Many projects are in motion to deal with this problem and some of them are considered to be quite feasible. Development and implementation of smart green houses and vertical farms are two major solutions for the expected crisis, but as other ICT-based systems, their security problems must be dealt with. Nevertheless, current network forensics is still unable to fully monitor and analyze computer network traffic to gather the evidences of malicious attacks or intrusions. Although major companies and government agencies have introduced various types of high-speed IDS into their networks, smaller firms or private organizations are unable to do so because of the cost involved. The lightweight IDS proposed in this study can be a suitable solution as this system can be operated with a common PC and peripherals. This system also underwent a test bed experiment and proved its efficiency. Jpcap library was used to capture transport packets which were then classified using typical communications protocols. The packet headers were subjected to analysis and the results were stored in database for later applications.

AB  - Consumption of basil (Ocimum basilicum) has been increasing worldwide in recent years because of its unique aromatic flavor and relatively high concentration of phenolics. To achieve a stable and reliable supply of basil, more growers are turning to indoor controlled-environment production with artificial lighting due to its high environmental controllability and sustainability. However, electricity cost for lighting is a major limiting factor to the commercial application of indoor vertical farming, and little information is available on the minimum light requirement to produce uniform and high-quality sweet basil. To determine the optimal daily light integral (DLI) for sweet basil production in indoor vertical farming, this study investigated the effects of five DLIs, namely, 9.3, 11.5, 12.9, 16.5, and 17.8 mol.m(-2).d(-1) on basil growth and quality. 'Improved Genovese Compact' sweet basil was treated with five DLIs provided by white fluorescent lamps (FLs) for 21 d after germination, and gas exchange rate, growth, yield, and nutritional quality of basil plants were measured to evaluate the effects of the different DLIs on basil growth and quality. Results indicated that basil plants grown under higher DLIs of 12.9, 16.5, or 17.8 mol.m(-2).d(-1) had higher net photosynthesis, transpiration, and stomatal conductance (gS), compared with those under lower DLIs of 9.3 and 11.5 mol.m(-2).d(-1). High DLIs resulted in lower chlorophyll (Chl) a+b concentration per leaf fresh weight (FW), higher Chl a/b ratios, and larger and thicker leaves of basil plants. The shoot FW under DLIs of 12.9, 16.5, and 17.8 mol.m(-2).d(-1) was 54.2%, 78.6%, and 77.9%, respectively, higher than that at a DLI of 9.3 mol.m(-2).d(-1). In addition, higher DLIs led to higher soluble sugar percent and dry matter percent than lower DLIs. The amounts of total anthocyanin, phenolics, and flavonoids per plant of sweet basil were also positively correlated to DLIs, and antioxidant capacity at a DLI of 17.8 mol.m(-2).d(-1) was 73% higher than that at a DLI of 9.3 mol.m(-2).d(-1). Combining the results of growth, yield, and nutritional quality of sweet basil, we suggest a DLI of 12.9 mol.m(-2).d(-1) for sweet basil commercial production in indoor vertical farming to minimize the energy cost while maintaining a high yield and nutritional quality.

AB  - Labor productivity in terms of material value (weight of plants harvested per hour per person) was evaluated for 6 months from the start of operations in a research facility at Osaka Prefecture University (Osaka, Japan), serving as a model system for plant production with sole-source lighting (also referred to as a "vertical farm'' or "plant factory''). The research facility is capable of producing lettuce plants (Lactuca sativa) at a maximum production rate of approximate to 5000 plants/day when the relative harvest rate (i.e., number of plants harvested/maximum potential number of plants harvested) is 100%. However, in the present study, the relative harvest rate at the research facility was in the range of 17% to 65% and labor productivity varied from 1.5 to 6.0 kg.h(-1) per person. The evaluation results indicated that increasing the weight of plants harvested and increasing the relative harvest rate was necessary to maintain a high level of labor productivity. The processing time for harvesting was greatest among all plant operations, suggesting the need to reduce the time taken in this operation to increase the labor productivity in the research facility and in other plant production systems with sole-source lighting (PPSLs). This study demonstrates the importance of analyzing labor productivity for increasing the commercial feasibility of PPSLs. However, further long-term investigation with higher relative harvest rates is required for a more definitive conclusion.

AB  - The suitable size of runner plants based on separation time from their stock plants was determined to maximize propagation rate of strawberry transplants using autotrophic transplant propagation method, a novel propagation method in a plant factory with artificial lighting for transplant production (T-PFAL). When runner tips with unfolded bracts were fixed on a growing medium to generate runner plants, the first true leaf, a runner, and roots of the runner plants appeared 6-10 days after fixing the runner tips (DAF), and their shoot and root dry weights significantly increased 6 and 10 DAF, respectively. The top/root ratio was the greatest 10 DAF. The net photosynthetic rate of runner plants 9, 11, and 13 DAF decreased after separation, while that at 15, 17, and 19 DAF did not. The runner plants separated from their stock plants 15, 20, and 25 DAF were successfully grown until 30 DAF; however, those 10 DAF was not. At 30 DAF, the root dry weight of the runner plants separated from the stock plants 15 DAF was smaller than that of the runner plants separated 20, 25, and 30 DAF, whereas the dry weights of leaves and runners were not significantly different. The use of small stock plants could reduce the required timescale from placing stock plants to produce new runner plants, but there was no significant difference in the timescales when the runner plants were separated 15 or 20 DAF due to the relatively insufficient growth of runner plants separated 15 DAF. These results indicate that runner plants separated 20 DAF, with two true leaves and a 5-mm crown diameter, would be suitable stock plants for the autotrophic transplant propagation method in a T-PFAL for strawberry propagation.

AB  - In recent decades, however, after a long period of intensive farming on a wide scale, no one doubts that high yields obtained were followed by a negative impact on the environment threatening the very future of agriculture while the methods of agriculture intensive is a real pressure on the natural resources that underpin agriculture.
   Among the negative effects it has intensive agriculture on the environment degradation, long-term and very long soil salinization excessive irrigated areas, pollution of surface and groundwater, increasing plant resistance to pesticides, loss of biodiversity in these areas, etc.
   Intensive agriculture has affected also the environment considerably by massive deforestation that have been made to obtain new arable land but also the emission into the atmosphere of greenhouse gases and other polluting substances.
   Vertical farming plants or animals should be placed in tall buildings, it is also seen as a way applicable to urban agriculture. There would be need heavy equipment and the distance from "farm to fork". According to the European Environment Agency Vertical farming could reduce CO2 emissions.

AB  - Rapidly growing demand for year-round fresh food, regardless of the weather or climate, is driving demand for controlled environment agriculture systems. Sales from greenhouses (GHs) are growing at 8.8%, while sales from vertical farms (VFs) are growing at 30%. It is commonly believed in industry circles that a VF cannot economically compete with a GH, due to the high cost of powering artificial lighting. Nonetheless, researchers have yet to analyze the economics underlying a VF, let alone compare the profitability of a VF to that of a GH. This research gap is particularly relevant to Canada, as it is uniquely positioned to be a leader in the VF market. Below, we report the results of a detailed simulation of the profitability of growing lettuce in a VF and in a GH located near Quebec City. Surprisingly, we find that the costs to both equip and run the two facilities are very similar, while the gross profit is slightly higher for the VF.

AB  - The main point is what is the role of public acceptability? The relevant question is how the public reacts and how we change our socio-cultural perception of Vertical Farming as a new technology or new innovation. The answer shows us the importance of study in related to the of Vertical Farming. There is a lack of comprehensive empirical studies exploring the status quo of Vertical Farming in all its different forms and functions. Existing empirical studies mostly focus on the construction technology or the agricultural technique of Vertical Farming. So far, no research addressed the factors contributing to the acceptance or rejection of Vertical Farming. The present research hopes to fill this gap and contribute to a better awareness of that. In this study, public acceptance as one of the important factor of accepting or rejecting the Vertical Farming is discussed and reviewed by qualitative approach. A comprehensive literature reviewed on public acceptance of Vertical Farming in relation to the food security. The study resources were formed from different sources from 2007 to 2017. Through its broad theoretical coverage, this research provides the valuable groundwork for future studies on public acceptance of Vertical Farming. Also, this body of research shed light on practical experiences or ways to solve current problems, and hope to encourage innovation or repeat projects that were successfully implemented elsewhere in the world.

AB  - Water containing ultra-fine bubbles (UFB) may promote plant growth. But, as UFBs are too small to distinguish from other impurities in a nutrient solution, it is not known if UFBs survive transport from the water source to the rhizosphere. Here we use the freeze-fracture replica method and a transmission electron microscope (TEM) to observe UFBs in the nutrient solutions used in a crop-growing system known as a plant factory. In this factory, TEM images taken from various points in the supply line indicate that the concentration of UFBs in the nutrient solution is conserved, starting from their addition to the nutrient solution in the buffer tank, through the peat-moss layer, all the way to the rhizosphere. Measurements also show that a thin film formed on the surface of UFBs in the nutrient solution, with greater film thickness at the rhizosphere. This film is considered to be made from the accumulation of impurities coming from solute and the peat-moss layer.

AB  - Leafy vegetable production under controlled environment using artificial lighting has many advantages over conventional greenhouses and open-field production. However, high initial investment and operation costs are restricting the wide application of this technology. In order to design an optimal artificial lighting environment for lettuce production, effects of different combinations of light intensity, photoperiod, and light quality on growth, quality, photosynthesis, and energy use efficiency of lettuce (Lactuca sativa L. cv Ziwei) were investigated under a closed plant factory. Lettuce transplants were grown under photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) at 150 mu mol/m(2).s, 200 mu mol/m(2).s, 250 mu mol/m(2).s, and 300 mu mol/m(2).s provided by fluorescent lamps (FL) with a red to blue ratio (R:B ratio) of 1.8 and light-emitting diode (LED) lamps with R: B ratio of 1.2 and 2.2, in combination with photoperiod of 12 and 16 h/d. In order to examine the "long term" photosynthetic characteristics, net photosynthetic rates of hydroponic lettuce leaves were continuously measured for 2 days (15th and 16th day after transplanting) before harvest. There was no difference in leaf fresh weight (FW) between PPFD of 250 mu mol/m(2).s and 300 mu mol/m(2).s with photoperiod of 16 h/d, regardless of light quality, and same results showed in contents of nitrate, soluble sugar, and vitamin C, respectively. The results of continuous measurements of net photosynthetic rate of lettuce leaves before harvest indicated that plants grown at PPFD of 250 mu mol/m(2).s had consistently higher compared to those grown at PPFD of 300 mu mol/m(2).s. Combining the results from growth, photosynthesis, quality, and energy consumption, it can be concluded that PPFD at 250 mu mol/m(2).s with photoperiod of 16 h/d under LED with R: B ratio of 2.2 is a suitable light environment for maximum growth and high quality of commercial lettuce (cv. Ziwei) production under indoor controlled environment.

AB  - Ultrastable red-emitting phosphor-in-glass (PiG) consisting of 3.5MgO center dot 0.5MgF(2)center dot GeO2:Mn4+ (MMG: Mn4+) phosphor in a glass matrix was prepared for superior artificial plant growth LEDs (PGLs). These obtained PiG plates show a thermal conductivity of 1.671 W m(-1)K(-1) and an external quantum efficiency of 27.5%, which provides the strong foundation for the application in high-power artificial plant growth LEDs (PGLs). Furthermore, a proof-of-concept PGL using 36 pieces of the title PiG plate and 420 nm-blue LED chip was fabricated. The combination of similar to 420 nm from chip and the similar to 659 nm chip from the MMG: Mn4+ phosphor provide a well-matched spectrum with the absorption bands of photosynthetic pigments and the phytochrome (P-R and P-FR) of most green plants. As expected, the as-fabricated PGL-treated milk-Chinese cabbage cultured in the indoor plant factory showed that after 15 day-irradiation, the plant biomass was nearly 48.9% greater in treated sample than those cultured using the general R-B LED lamps. Further analysis also demonstrated that promotive effect can also be obtained in the level of ascorbic acid, soluble protein, soluble sugar and total chlorophyll. The PiG strategy presented in this paper afforded superior high-power artificial plant growth LEDs, which are crucial in the application of ecological agriculture.

AB  - An optimal design of light-emitting diode (LED) lighting that benefits both the photosynthesis performance for plants and the visional health for human eyes has drawn considerable attention. In the present study, we have developed a multi-color driving algorithm that serves as a liaison between desired spectral power distributions and pulse-width-modulation duty cycles. With the aid of this algorithm, our multi-color plant-growth light sources can optimize correlated-color temperature (CCT) and color rendering index (CRI) such that photosynthetic luminous efficacy of radiation (PLER) is maximized regardless of the number of LEDs and the type of photosynthetic action spectrum (PAS). In order to illustrate the accuracies of the proposed algorithm and the practicalities of our plant-growth light sources, we choose six color LEDs and German PAS for experiments. Finally, our study can help provide a useful guide to improve light qualities in plant factories, in which long-term co-inhabitance of plants and human beings is required.

AB  - This paper discusses the emerging need for vertical farms by examining issues related to food security, urban population growth, farmland shortages, "food miles", and associated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Urban planners and agricultural leaders have argued that cities will need to produce food internally to respond to demand by increasing population and to avoid paralyzing congestion, harmful pollution, and unaffordable food prices. The paper examines urban agriculture as a solution to these problems by merging food production and consumption in one place, with the vertical farm being suitable for urban areas where available land is limited and expensive. Luckily, recent advances in greenhouse technologies such as hydroponics, aeroponics, and aquaponics have provided a promising future to the vertical farm concept. These high-tech systems represent a paradigm shift in farming and food production and offer suitable and efficient methods for city farming by minimizing maintenance and maximizing yield. Upon reviewing these technologies and examining project prototypes, we find that these efforts may plant the seeds for the realization of the vertical farm. The paper, however, closes by speculating about the consequences, advantages, and disadvantages of the vertical farm's implementation. Economic feasibility, codes, regulations, and a lack of expertise remain major obstacles in the path to implementing the vertical farm.

AB  - Research on closed plant production systems, such as artificially illuminated and highly insulated plant factories, has offered perspectives for urban food production but more insight is needed into their resource use efficiency. This paper assesses the potential of this 'novel' system for production in harsh climates with either low or high temperatures and solar radiation levels.
   The performance of plant factories is compared with cultivation in traditional greenhouses by analysing the use of resources in the production of lettuce. We applied advanced climate models for greenhouses and buildings, coupled with a lettuce model that relates growth to microclimate. This analysis was performed for three different climate zones and latitudes (24-68 degrees N).
   In terms of energy efficiency, plant factories (1411 MJ kg(-1) dry weight) outperform even the most efficient greenhouse (Sweden with artificial illumination; 1699 MJ kg(-1) dry weight). Additionally, plant factories achieve higher productivity for all other resources (water, CO2 and land area). With respect to purchased energy, however, greenhouses excel as they use freely available solar energy for photosynthesis. The production of 1 kg dry weight of lettuce requires an input of 247 kWhe in a plant factory, compared to 70, 111, 182 and 211 kWhe in greenhouses in respectively the Netherlands, United Arab Emirates and Sweden (with and without additional artificial illumination).
   The local scarcity of resources determines the suitability of production systems. Our quantitative analysis provides insight into the effect of external climate on resource productivity in plant factories and greenhouses. By elucidating the impact of the absence of solar energy, this provides a starting point for determining the economic viability of plant factories.

AB  - This research aims to analyze the food energy interactive nexus of sustainable urban plant factory systems. Plant factory systems grow agricultural products within artificially controlled growing environment and multi-layer vertical growing systems. The system controls the supply of light, temperature, humidity, nutrition, water, and carbon dioxide for growing plants. Plant factories are able to produce consistent and high-quality agricultural products within less production space for urban areas. The production systems use less labor, pesticide, water, and nutrition. However, food production of plant factories has many challenges including higher energy demand, energy costs, and installation costs of artificially controlled technologies. In the research, stochastic optimization model and linear complementarity models are formulated to conduct optimal and equilibrium food energy analysis of plant factory production. A case study of plant factories in the Taiwanese market is presented.

AB  - Globally, industries and economies have undergone rapid development and expansion over the last several decades. As a result, global warming and environmental contaminations have resulted in climate change and jeopardized food security. In many developing countries, already decreasing crop yields are threatened by extreme weather and soil damaged by genetically modified food, making environmental problems worse and increasing food and organic product prices. For these reasons, this study proposes a hybrid multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) model for new product development (NPD) in the light-emitting diode- (LED-) based lighting plant factory. First, literature reviews and expert interviews are employed in constructing a list of decision-making objectives and criteria for new product development. Then, a fuzzy Delphi method (FDM) is used to screen the elements of the objectives and criteria, while a fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (FDEMATEL) is used to determine the relationships among the objectives and criteria. Finally, a fuzzy analytic network process (FANP) and a composite priority vector (CPV) are manipulated to determine the relative importance weights of the critical objectives and criteria. Results show that the proposed method can create a useful and assessable MCDM model for decision-making applications in new product development, and a case study is herein performed to validate the feasibility of the proposed model in a Taiwanese LED-based lighting plant factory, which not only provides the decision-makers with a feasible hierarchical data structure for decision-making guidance but also increases the competitive advantages of trade-offs on developing novel products.

AB  - The objective of this research was to develop a model to measure the external quality traits using Multi-Spectral Image Sensor (MSIS) in lettuce. In addition, this study was conducted to examine the effect of different intensities of LED mixed light on the growth of lettuce in a closed-type plant factory. The prediction models of lettuce growth data (shoot fresh weight, shoot dry weight, and leaf area) were developed using the correlation between growth data and the number of pixels on an acquired image. Also, SPAD value prediction models were developed using the correlation between the reflectance of a lettuce leaf in an acquired multi-spectral image and the measured SPAD value of the lettuce leaf The characteristics of lettuce growth according to the light intensity in a closed-type plant factory was conducted under light intensities of 100, 150, and 200 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1). At 200 mu mol.s(-1) light intensity, the shoot fresh weight increased about 27.37-73.93% when compared to 100 and 150 mu mo1.m(-2).s(-1) on 20 days after sowing. The shoot dry weight showed a similar tendency. Lettuce leaf area increased by 6.89-52.52% on 20 days after sowing when compared to plants grown under 100 and 150 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1). At a light intensity of 200 mu mol.m(-2)s(-1), the SPAD value increased about 3.56-23.76% when compared to plants grown under 100 and 150 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1). Using prediction models based on the number of pixels on a lettuce leaf image, lettuce growth data (shoot fresh weight, shoot dry weight, and leaf area) can be predicted with high precision. In addition, the prediction models for SPAD value were developed using the vegetation indices NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), GNDVI (Green NDVI), NIR/Red ratio, NIR/Green ratio, and Red/Green ratio. The SPAD values were predicted with relatively high precision (R-2 = 0.834) using the prediction model based on NIR/Red.

AB  - The production of crops in controlled environments is a growing sector of modern agriculture. The objective of this study was to determine the optimal concentration of culture nutrient solution for the production of carrot leaves in a closed-type plant factory. After sowing, seedlings at the two-true-leaf stage were transplanted to a growing bed system. Hydroponic cultivation was performed using a three-layer NFT system. Culture nutrient solutions were supplied at three electrical conductivity (EC) levels (2.0, 3.0, and 4.0 dS.m(-1)). Measurements of plant growth characteristics, including fresh weight, dry weight, plant height, and leaf area, were performed 14 and 23 days after planting. Differences in culture nutrient solution concentrations did not affect leaf number and chlorophyll content, and did not cause significant difference in antioxidant capacities and total phenol content of carrot plants. However, contents of total phenol, chlorogenic acid, and kaempferol were highest in plants grown in the EC 2.0 dS.m(-1) solution, whereas those grown in the EC 3.0 dS.m(-1) solution had the highest fresh and dry weights. Collectively, our results indicate that an EC 3.0 dS.m(-1) culture nutrient solution combined with a cultivation period of 20-25 days is optimal for the hydroponic cultivation of carrot leaves in a controlled environment. In addition, we found that carrot leaves contain antioxidant compounds and are thus suitable as a leaf vegetable.

AB  - Light-emitting diode (LED) technology is paving the way to increase crop production efficiency with electric lamps. Users can select specific wavelengths to elicit targeted photomorphogenic, biochemical, or physiological plants responses. In addition, LEDs can help control the seasonality of flowering plants to accurately schedule uniform flowering based on predetermined market dates. Research has shown that the monochromatic nature of LEDs can help prevent physiological disorders that are common in indoor environments, and help reduce incidence of pest and disease pressure in agriculture, which could ultimately increase crop production efficiency by preventing crop losses. Furthermore, a significant attribute of LED technology is the opportunity to reduce energy costs associated with electric lighting. Studies have shown that by increasing canopy photon capture efficiency and/or precisely controlling light output in response to the environment or to certain physiological parameters, energy efficiency and plant productivity can be optimized with LEDs. Future opportunities with LED lighting include the expansion of the vertical farming industry, applications for space-based plant growth systems, and potential solutions to support off-grid agriculture.

AB  - Control of indoor temperature and humidity is of critical concern for controlled environment agriculture systems in hot, arid regions. Evaporative cooling is a technology utilized for energy-efficient cooling and humidification of these systems. However, the evaporative cooling process consumes considerable amounts of water, as much as 80-90% of the water footprint for indoor food production in these regions. The use of saline water in place of fresh water in evaporative cooling systems offers a potential solution for greatly improving the sustainability of these systems. However, the use of saline water in industry-standard cellulose pad systems can cause premature clogging of the porous medium, leading to system failure and the need for porous media replacement. A new evaporative cooling technology consisting of crushed pozzolan volcanic rock formed into porous bricks was evaluated for use in controlled environment agriculture systems using saline water. Two brick designs were tested for proof of concept cooling of commercial-scale greenhouses. Temperature-based cooling efficiencies of the bricks were achieved that are comparable to cellulose pads. In addition, the pozzolan-based bricks showed impressive resistance to saline water and harsh environments, requiring no replacement over the duration of the experimental trials. The integration of the pozzolan evaporative cooling systems using sea or brackish water with a water-saving growing technology, such as recirculating aquaponics or hydroponics, shows promise for reducing the fresh water footprint of food raised indoors in hot, dry environments by as much as 80%-90%.

TI  - Flavonoid Productivity Optimized for Green and Red Forms of Perilla frutescens via Environmental Control Technologies in Plant Factory
T2  - JOURNAL OF FOOD QUALITY
LA  - English
KW  - CANCER CHEMOPREVENTION
KW  - SECONDARY METABOLITES
AB  - Perilla frutescens (Lamiaceae) is a dietary staple in Asia. It is an abundant source of flavonoids that are bioactively beneficial to human health and fitness. The current popularity of plant-based consumption is being driven by the healthful benefits of bioactive nutrition, and the concentration of bioactive agents found in raw plant materials is an important factor in the assessment of food quality. To test the feasibility of promoting flavonoid productivity in perilla plants via environmental treatment, plant factory technology was applied to perilla plant cultivation. Apigenin (AG) and luteolin (LT) are two of the most potent anticarcinogenic flavonoids in perilla, and these are also found in many vegetables and fruits. Quantitative analysis of AG and LT was conducted on plants cultivated under nine environmental forms of treatment imposed by three levels of light intensity (100, 200, and 300 mu molm(-2)s(-1)) combined with three levels of nutrient-solution concentration (1.0, 2.0, and 3.0dSm(-1)) for hydroculture. The contents of AG in green and red perilla plant were increased by high nutrient-solution levels under the same light intensity. In green perilla, the highest concentration of AG (8.50 mu gg(-1)) was obtained under treatment of the highest level of nutrient-solution (3.0dSm(-1)) and 200 mu molm(-2)s(-1) of light intensity, whereas in red perilla, the highest concentration of AG (6.38 mu gg(-1)) was achieved from the highest levels of both of these forms of treatment (300 mu molm(-2)s(-1) and 3.0dSm(-1)). The increase in AG content per plant between the lowest and the highest levels was recorded by 6.4-fold and 8.6-fold in green and red perilla, respectively. The behavior of LT concentration differed between green and red forms of perilla. LT concentration in red perilla was enhanced under nutrient deficiency (1.0dSm(-1)) and affected by light intensity. Different responses were observed in the accumulations of AG and LT in red and green perilla during treatments, and this phenomenon was discussed in terms of biosynthetic pathways that involve the expressions of phenylpropanoids and anthocyanins. The total yield of flavonoids (AG and LT) was improved with the optimization of those forms of treatment, with the best total yields: 33.9mgplant(-1) in green Perilla; 10.0mgplant(-1) in red perilla, and a 4.9-fold and a 5.4-fold increase was recorded in green and red perilla, respectively. This study revealed that flavone biosynthesis and accumulation in perilla plants could be optimized via environmental control technologies, and this approach could be applicable to leafy vegetables with bioactive nutrition to produce a stable industrial supply of high flavonoid content.

AB  - Many methods of protected agriculture are used to modify the growing environment of plants. Ideally, plant production would take place in regions that do not require protective structures, regions that present ideal temperatures, no harsh extremes, and sufficient but not excess precipitation. This is not the case however, as most countries, save for a select few, require various forms of controlled environment agriculture to protect crops against climatic and environmental extremes. Although the greenhouse industry has developed vast amounts of technology for the temperate climate regions of our planet, much remains to be improved in terms of protected agriculture in the more extreme climates. Tropical, arid, polar and urban locations offer contrasting environments that present various challenges for plant growth. Some challenges are specific to each location, while others are common across them. Tropical and arid climates offer high solar radiation, but present harsh temperature and relative humidity conditions. Most protected agriculture structures are relatively open in nature to ventilate and discharge heat, but are susceptible to pests and diseases. On the other hand, polar climates and urban environments often lack solar radiation and require a high level of control of the air quality. The structures used in these environments are relatively enclosed to entrap heat (polar) and to make efficient use of space. The sustainability of available technologies and energy efficiency are important themes present in all discussed climates and environments. Protected agriculture technologies offer solutions to growers in locations with extreme climates wishing to produce high yields of high quality crop, and this article presents a review of the existing challenges and of the advancements made in this field.

The results are given as a series of producing capacity curves for salad and basil plants when irradiating by quasi-monochromatic spectrum for three PAR ranges: blue, green and red. In the experiment, levels of photosynthetic photon irradiance (70 divided by 230) mu mol/s.m(2) and of irradiance (13 divided by 60) W/m(2) were varied within a wide range. "Rough" spectra of optical radiation action estimated over producing capacity of plants with different irradiance levels are given, and questions of additivity of different spectral radiation influence in forming vegetable biomass are considered.
   Evaluations of efficiency of various PAR intervals for synthesis of biochemical combinations determining nutrition facts of the studied cultures are performed.

AB  - Mini-plug transplant seedlings of Norway spruce have been cultivated in closed growth systems, so-called plant factories, for few years. The aim of the experiment was to define a short-day treatment (SD) that harden seedlings to sustain 3 months of cold storage, but does not have adverse effects on growth, morphology, and vitality. The seedlings were subjected to one of the following treatments: (1) 12h photoperiod + 3 weeks duration; (2) 8h photoperiod + 3wk duration; (3) 12h photoperiod + 5wk duration; and (4) 8h photoperiod + 5wk SD. All the SD treatments yielded healthy seedlings that grew well after the cold storage. The frost hardiness of the seedlings improved when the photoperiod was reduced from 12 to 8h, and when the SD duration was increased from 3 weeks to 5 weeks, but reducing the photoperiod from 12h to 8h caused growth reductions. The root and shoot regrowth after cold storage was highest in seedlings that had received 12h photoperiod and 5wk duration. However, 12h photoperiod and 3wk duration may be an adequate practice for nurseries that treat multiple crops in their SD facilities.

AB  - Greenhouse cultivation has evolved from simple covered rows of open-fields crops to highly sophisticated controlled environment agriculture (CEA) facilities that projected the image of plant factories for urban agriculture. The advances and improvements in CEA have promoted the scientific solutions for the efficient production of plants in populated cities and multi-story buildings. Successful deployment of CEA for urban agriculture requires many components and subsystems, as well as the understanding of the external influencing factors that should be systematically considered and integrated. This review is an attempt to highlight some of the most recent advances in greenhouse technology and CEA in order to raise the awareness for technology transfer and adaptation, which is necessary for a successful transition to urban agriculture. This study reviewed several aspects of a high-tech CEA system including improvements in the frame and covering materials, environment perception and data sharing, and advanced microclimate control and energy optimization models. This research highlighted urban agriculture and its derivatives, including vertical farming, rooftop greenhouses and plant factories which are the extensions of CEA and have emerged as a response to the growing population, environmental degradation, and urbanization that are threatening food security. Finally, several opportunities and challenges have been identified in implementing the integrated CEA and vertical farming for urban agriculture.

AB  - We determined the effects of various frequencies of pulsed light-emitting diode (LED) irradiation on the growth characteristics of Lactuca sativa L. 'Sunmang'. Seedlings were grown in a 20 degrees C growth chamber with photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) of 253.67 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1) and a 12-h photoperiod for 18 days. The seedlings were then transplanted into pots containing a growing medium, followed by placement in growth chambers equipped with a combination of red (R), white (W), and blue (B) LEDs (R:W:B = 7:2:1) that provided pulsed irradiation at various frequencies (0.3, 1, 3, 10, and 30 kHz) at 75% duty ratio (PPFD 190 mu mol.m(-2). s(-1)). The control (continuous irradiation) was compared with the treatments 4 weeks after transplanting. Most growth parameters such as shoot fresh weight and leaf area under pulsed LEDs were similar to those of the control. Treatments with lower frequencies (0.3, 1, and 3 kHz) were more effective for growth even though the light intensity was lower than that in the control. No significant difference was observed in the maximum quantum yield of PSII and photosynthetic rates between the treatments. Macronutrient (K, Ca, and Mg) levels were significantly higher under all treatments compared to the control. Light use efficiency was the highest under irradiation with 1 kHz pulsed LEDs. In conclusion, pulsed LEDs with 75% duty ratio and low frequencies did not show significant inhibition on plant growth, suggesting that pulsed LED irradiation technology has a potential to save energy consumption for producing crops in plant factories.

AB  - The pursuit of urban agriculture as part of a city's green infrastructure is often a challenge, particularly within compact cities, where there is a limited amount of space between buildings for urban farming and gardening. Instead, such high-rise urban developments present often under-utilized spaces on the vertical surfaces of buildings. A key unknown is the adequacy of light for plant growth. Many leafy vegetables that require high amounts of light form a significant proportion of the staple diet in many Asian countries. We report on the assessment of sunlight adequacy for growing leafy vegetables in a compact tropical city, based on the high-rise and high-density residential environment of Singapore. Leaf physiological traits of seven leafy vegetables were assessed and used to estimate plant light requirements. A survey of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) along exposed corridors showed that the daily light integral (DLI) value ranged from 2 to 35 mol m(-2) d(-1) under relatively ideal weather conditions during days with abundant solar insolation, and facades that experienced a minimum of half-day direct insolation matched the light requirements of vegetables within the moderate to very high-light categories. With regard to the building form, PAR increased gradually with height, but remains highly influenced by facade orientation and configuration. Owing to the annual north-south oscillation of the sun's path, reduced annual PAR variability and higher total annual PAR at facades, buildings with an east-west orientation will better support continuous vegetable cultivation, especially for basic building typologies without self-shading configurations. However, excessive PAR and temperatures during mid-day hours may hinder plant growth. By highlighting such patterns in levels of PAR, this study confirms the potential for high-rise and high-density conditions in the tropics to support farming using typically under-utilized vertical spaces of residential buildings.

AB  - This study investigated the growth characteristics of lettuce (Lactuca sativa L. 'Jeokchima') according to the position of air anion treatment in a closed-type plant factory. The experimental conditions in the plant factory were as follows: fluorescent light with photoperiod of 16/8 h (light/dark), temperature of 20 +/- 2 degrees C and 50 +/- 5% relative humidity. The nutrient solutions had a pH of 6.0 +/- 0.5 and 1.8 +/- 0.2 dS.m(-1) electrical conductivity (EC). The plants were transplanted into the factory from a plastic bed and exposed to air anion treatment from three different positions (sideward, upward, and downward) for 4 weeks. The growth characteristics of lettuce (leaf length and width, shoot fresh weight and shoot dry weight, leaf area, chlorophyll content, antioxidant capacity, and total phenol content) were measured at 3 weeks and 4 weeks. After 4 weeks in the downward anion treatment, lettuce leaves were 14% longer and 21.5% wider than the leaves of the control plants. Furthermore, the shoot fresh weight of lettuce grown in the downward anion treatment was 37.1% greater than that of the control lettuce. Similar results were observed for shoot dry weight. Out of the 3 positions of anion generation, the downward position produced lettuces with the greatest leaf area The chlorophyll content of lettuce decreased during all of the anion treatments. The antioxidative activity and total phenol content of lettuce decreased during the downward anion treatment. These results imply that the optimum position of anion treatment for increasing lettuce production in closed-type plant factories is the downward position.

AB  - Agriculture faces huge challenges regarding sustainable use of soils and its sustainability performance in general. There are three different approaches to sustainable agricultural production commonly proposed, namely intensification, agro-ecological approaches and high-tech industrial approaches. Often, some propose that only agro-ecological approaches are truly sustainable options, with particular benefits for soil protection, while others argue that intensification or high-tech perfonns better through land sparing. In this viewpoint, we scrutinize the notion of "sustainable agricultural production" and the role these approaches may play for such, in particular addressing the controversy of "naturalness" versus "artificiality" in production systems. Consumers often perceive agriculture as "natural", but agriculture today thrives always on strong human intervention. We posit that agriculture is linked to soils and natural processes, but that this provides little guidance on what sustainable agriculture should be. Being "natural" need not be an aspect of being sustainable. If it is, arguments for this need to be provided. Furthermore, revealed consumer preferences may much less frequently posit being "natural" as a central criterion for food consumed than usually assumed. By all this, we do not want to promote any of those three approaches uncritically. We rather argue for enlarging the option space for sustainable agriculture in an unprejudiced way.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the effect of irradiation of various spectrums generated by light-emitting diodes (LEDs) on the growth and accumulation of bioactive compounds in dropwort (Oenanthe stolonifera). Dropwort plants with 2-3 offshoots were grown under three monochromatic LEDs:red (R; 654 nm), blue (B; 456 nm), and green (G; 518 nm), thirteen combinations of R and B (R:B = 9:1, 8:2, 7:3, and 6:4), RB with G (R:G:B = 9:1:0, 8:1:1, 7:1:2, and 6:1:3), and RB with white (W) (R:W:B = 8:2:0, 8:1:1, 7:2:1, 7:1:2, and 6:2:2) and fluorescent lamps (control) for 6 weeks. R LEDs improved growth characteristics, including plant height and fresh and dry weights of shoots. Combined LEDs with 70-80% red wavelength resulted in the highest values in fresh weight. The B LED treatment resulted in the highest total phenolic and anthocyanin content in dropwort leaves, which increased in the combined LEDs treatments as the proportion of blue wavelength increased. Further, the RWB treatments, regardless of the ratio, resulted in higher anthocyanin contents than that in the RB and RGB treatments. Persicarin content was also significantly higher in the B treatment than in the R and G treatments. However, compared to the RB treatments, persicarin content in the RGB and RWB treatments was decreased, on average, by 72 and 64%, respectively. We suggested that the light spectrum is closely related to the enhancement of growth and bioactive compounds. Our findings provide basic information for designing lighting systems in plant factories to improve the growth and bioactive compounds in dropwort.

AB  - In this study, effects of alternating red light (R) and blue light (B) provided by LEDs on the growth and nutritional properties of 'Green Oak leaf lettuce were examined. Four alternating light treatments (R/B) had the same 8.64 mu mol m(-2) daily light integral (DLI) and similar R:B ratio (2:1), but different R/B alternating intervals that were respectively 8 h, 4 h, 2 h, and 1 h during a 16 h photoperiod. Two simultaneous light treatments, one of which (RB) had the same DLI and energy consumption with the alternating light treatments, while the other (RB') had the same photoperiod with the alternating light treatments were set up to compare the concurrently and alternately provided R and B. Results showed that different types of radiation led to obvious morphological changes, plants with simultaneous RB appeared the most sparse while those with RB' looked the most compact. Plant height/width and leaf length/width were all the highest under R/B (8 h) followed by R/B (1 h). Lettuce biomass under RB' was significantly higher than others, more than twice that under RB, R/B (4 h) and R/B (2 h), but less than twice that under R/B (8 h) and R/B (1 h). RB' significantly decreased the soluble sugar content by 9%-32% while increased crude fiber content by 14%-39% compared with others. Significantly higher ascorbic acid content as well as lower nitrate content were detected in lettuce under R/B (4 h) and R/B (2 h), while significantly lower ascorbic acid content as well as higher nitrate content were detected in lettuce under R/B (8 h) and R/B (1 h). In all, based on the same energy consumption, R/B (8 h) and R/B (1 h) resulted in higher yield, while R/B (4 h) and R/B (2 h) brought about higher nutritive value compared with the cocurrent light RB. Therefore, we conclude that lettuce growth and qualities can be purposely adjusted by adopting different alternating intervals of red and blue light. Meanwhile, the alternating modes will provide methods for deeply studying the relationship of red and blue light when acting on plants.

AB  - In this paper, based on core technologies such as overcoming a place's limitations, light that can substitute for the sunlight, automation, nutrient supply system and temperature, and intelligent situation recognition for solar power generation, geothermal HVAC (heating, ventilating, and air conditioning), a plant growth analysis system for vegetation factories was designed. The system is likely to improve the freshness of agricultural products through order and planned productions, to create new markets through the convergence of the IT and BT industries, and to promote convenience in farming and comfort in workspaces through automatic control, robot development, etc. In addition, the system is expected to offer opportunities for urban residents to experience and learn the whole process of a plant's growth; to provide a leisurely life, such as a downtown oasis, to those who are tired of the dreary city life; to prevent environmental pollution through the effective use of recycled resources; and to produce and stably supply diverse agricultural products all year round, regardless of the weather. Also, we propose a medical condition measurement, including the water content of the plant leaf using the reflected light of the plant leaf in the visible light range NIR(near infrared) region. Proposed a result, the image coordinates (X, Y) for an analysis of a specific wavelength by the refractive index (Z) of a specific wavelength in a specific disease and plants having common characteristics and the refractive index distribution of the refractive index outside the selective wavelength of the plant leaf with respect to the plant were classified by using a specific disease and to predict the characteristics of a plant stress. Therefore, the visible light region and the absorption region due to the moisture including the NIR region 1.4 [mu m] by utilizing the reflectance of the wavelength was measured by the change in the abnormal activity in normal metabolic activity and diseases of the plants leaves.

AB  - Photosynthetic responses to light are dependent on light intensity, vary among species, and can be affected by acclimation to different light environments (e.g., light intensity, spectrum, and photoperiod). Understanding how these factors affect photochemistry is important for improving supplemental lighting efficiency in controlled-environment agriculture. We used chlorophyll fluorescence to determine photochemical light response curves of three horticultural crops with contrasting light requirements [sweetpotato (Ipomea batatas), lettuce (Lactuca sativa), and pothos (Epipremnum aureum)]. We also quantified how these responses were affected by acclimation to three shading treatments-full sun, 44% shade, and 75% shade. The quantum yield of photosystem II (Phi(PSII)), a measure of photochemical efficiency, decreased exponentially with increasing photosynthetic photon flux (PPF) in all three species. By contrast, linear electron transport rate (ETR) increased asymptotically with increasing PPF. Within each shading level, the high-light-adapted species sweetpotato used high light more efficiently for electron transport than light-intermediate lettuce and shade-tolerant pothos. Within a species, plants acclimated to high light (full sun) tended to have higher FPSII and ETR than those acclimated to low light (44% or 75% shade). Nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ) (an indicator of the amount of absorbed light energy that is dissipated as heat) was upregulated with increasing PPF; faster upregulation was observed in pothos as well as in plants grown under 75% shade. Our results have implications for supplemental lighting: supplemental light is used more efficiently and results in a greater increase in ETR when provided at low ambient PPF. In addition, high-light-adapted crops and crops grown under relatively high ambient light can use supplemental light more efficiently than low-light-adapted crops or those grown under low ambient light.

AB  - The aim of this study was to analyze the growth and phytochemical composition of Crepidiastrum denticulatum, a valuable medicinal plant, in response to various periods of irradiation and ratios of far-red (FR) LED light combined with red (R) and blue (B) LED lights. Three-week-old C. denticulatum seedlings were transplanted to a hydroponic system in a plant factory equipped with R, B, and FR LEDs. The ratio of R to B LEDs was set at 8:2 (R8B2), and the ratio of R to FR LEDs was adjusted to 0.7, 1.2, 4.1, and 8.6. R8B2 (without FR LEDs) and commercial LEDs were used as control I and II, respectively. The plants were cultivated under these light treatments, and some of the control plants were subjected to four different R/FR ratios for 30 min before the end of the light period (EOL). We measured growth characteristics, total phenolic contents, and the levels of individual phenolic compounds (chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, and chicoric acid) 6 weeks after treatment. Shoot fresh and dry weight, leaf area, leaf length, and leaf width under R/FR ratios of 0.7 and 1.2 were 1.8- to 2.4-times higher than those of the control plants. Continuous R/FR 0.7 and 1.2 irradiation reduced the total phenolic content per dry weight compared to the control, although this effect was not significant. The total phenolic content per plant under R/FR 0.7 and 1.2 increased more than 2-fold, and the shoot fresh weight increased 1.7- and 1.6-fold, compared to control I. Individual phenolic compound levels exhibited the same trends as total phenolic content. Under R/FR 0.7 and 1.2, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, and chicoric acid levels per shoot increased 1.3- to 1.8-fold compared to control I. FR EOL treatments did not have a significant effects on growth or the contents of bioactive compounds. These results suggest that supplemental irradiation with FR LEDs could be used to improve C. denticulatum growth and quality in terms of phytochemical composition when grown in a plant factory with artificial lighting.

AB  - Transplant production in a plant factory with artificial lighting provides several benefits; (1) rapid and uniform transplant production, (2) high production rate per unit area, and (3) production of disease free transplants production. To improve the growth of runner plants when strawberry transplants are produced in a plant factory, we conducted two experiments to investigate (1) the effect of different light intensity for stock and runner plants on the growth of runner plants, and (2) the effect of different container volume for runner plants on their growth. When the stock and runner plants were grown under nine different light conditions composed of three different light intensities (100, 200, and 400 mu mol.m(-2) .s(-1) PPF) for each stock and runner plants, increasing the light intensity for stock plants promoted the growth of runner plants, however, the growth of runner plants was not enhanced by increasing the light intensity for runner plants under same light intensity condition for stock plants. We also cultivated runner plants using plug trays with four different container volumes (21, 34, 73, and 150 mL) for 20 days after placing the stock plants, and found that using plug trays with lager container volume did not enhance the growth of runner plants. These results indicate that providing optimal condition for stock plants, rather than the runner plants, is more important for increasing the growth of the runner plants and that the efficiency of strawberry transplant production in a plant factory can be improved by decreasing light intensity or container volume for runner plants.

AB  - The Central Valley in the State of California alone produces most of our nation's fruits and vegetables and represents just 1% of the nation's farmland. Since California's recent drought was the worst in the last 1200 years, supply of these products may decrease and new sources are needed. To understand the efficacy of growing fruits and vegetables more locally, the energy, water and nutrient impacts of growing fruits and vegetables in local hydroponic and aquaponic controlled environment agriculture systems are compared to vegetables grown in California and shipped to Atlanta, GA. Hydroponically and aquaponically grown fruits and vegetables have areal productivities 29 and 10 times higher than CA-grown vegetables while hydroponically grown vegetables consume 30 times more energy than the CA-grown vegetables. There appears to be no difference in energy consumption between aquaponically- and CA-grown vegetables. On average, 66 and 8 times more water is used in CA-grown vegetables compared to the hydroponic and aquaponic growing techniques. Approximately double the nitrogen needed by plants is applied to CA grown fruits and vegetables which suggests nitrogen is lost in runoff causing eutrophication downstream. There are 20,348 and 10 times twenty times more rainfall, nutrients in domestic wastewater and vacant land needed to supply the water, nutrient and space requirements for vegetable production in Atlanta, GA.

AB  - In recent years, consumption of herb products has increased in daily diets, contributing to the prevention of cardiovascular diseases, chronic diseases, and certain types of cancer owing to high concentrations of phytonutrients such as essential oils and phenolic compounds. To meet the increasing demand for high quality herbs, controlled environment agriculture is an alternative and a supplement to field production. Light is one of the most important environmental factors influencing herb quality including phytonutrient content, in addition to effects on growth and development. The recent development and adoption of light-emitting diodes provides opportunities for targeted regulation of growth and phytonutrient accumulation by herbs to optimize productivity and quality under controlled environments. For most herb species, red light supplemented with blue light significantly increased plant yield. However, plant yield decreased when the blue light proportion (BP) reached a threshold, which varied among species. Research has also shown that red, blue, and ultraviolet (UV) light enhanced the concentration of essential oils and phenolic compounds in various herbs and improved antioxidant capacities of herbs compared with white light or sunlight, yet these improvement effects varied among species, compounds, and light treatments. In addition to red and blue light, other light spectra within the photosynthetically active region-such as cyan, green, yellow, orange, and far-red light-are absorbed by photosynthetic pigments and utilized in leaves. However, only a few selected ranges of light spectra have been investigated, and the effects of light quality (spectrum distribution of light sources) on herb production are not fully understood. This paper reviews how light quality affected the growth and phytonutrient accumulation of both culinary and medicinal herbs under controlled environments, and discusses future research opportunities to produce high quantity and quality herbs.

AB  - "Plant factory with artificial lighting'' (PFAL) refers to a plant production facility that can achieve mass production of vegetables year round in a controlled environment. However, the high-density planting pattern in PFALs causes low light conditions in the lower canopy, leading to leaf senescence in the outer leaves and thus to reductions in plant yields. In the present study, the effect of supplemental upward lighting underneath the plants on photosynthetic characteristics and plant yield was examined in lettuce, in comparison with supplemental downward lighting from above the plants at the same light intensity. Supplemental upward lighting increased the curvature factor of the photosynthetic response to light from above the plants. Moreover, supplemental upward lighting significantly enhanced the lettuce yield by retarding the senescence of the outer leaves. Here, we propose a novel cultivation system with a combination of downward lighting and supplemental upward lighting that can effectively increase plant growth and yield in PFALs.

AB  - The global demand for medicinal plants is increasing. The quality of plants grown outdoors, however, is difficult to control. Myriad environmental factors influence plant growth and directly impact biosynthetic pathways, thus affecting the secondary metabolism of bioactive compounds. Plant factories use artificial lighting to increase the quality of medicinal plants and stabilize production. Photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) and electrical conductivity (EC) of nutrient solutions are two important factors that substantially influence perilla (Perilla frutescens, Labiatae) plant growth and quality. To identify suitable levels of PPFD and EC for perilla plants grown in a plant factory, the growth, photosynthesis, and accumulation of secondary metabolites in red and green perilla plants were measured at PPFD values of 100, 200, and 300 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) in nutrient solutions with EC values of 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 dS m(-1). The results showed significant interactive effects between PPFD and EC for both the fresh and dry weights of green perilla, but not for red perilla. The fresh and dry weights of shoots and leafy areas were affected more by EC than by PPFD in green perilla, whereas they were affected more by PPFD than by EC in red perilla. Leaf net photosynthetic rates were increased as PPFD increased in both perilla varieties, regardless of EC. The perillaldehyde concentration (mg g(-1)) in red perilla was unaffected by the treatments, but accumulation in plants (mg per plant) was significantly enhanced as the weight of dry leaves increased. Perillaldehyde concentrations in green perilla showed significant differences between combinations of the highest PPFD with the highest EC and the lowest PPFD with the lowest EC. Rosmarinic acid concentration (mg g(-1)) was increased in a combination of low EC and high PPFD conditions. Optimal cultivation conditions of red and green perilla in plant factory will be discussed in terms of plant growth and contents of medicinal ingredients.

AB  - Population growth and rapid urbanisation may result in a shortage of food supplies for cities in the foreseeable future. Research on closed plant production systems, such as plant factories, has attempted to offer perspectives for robust (urban) agricultural systems. Insight into the explicit role of plant processes in the total energy balance of these production systems is required to determine their potential. We describe a crop transpiration model that is able to determine the relation between sensible and latent heat exchange, as well as the corresponding vapour flux for the production of lettuce in closed systems. Subsequently, this model is validated for the effect of photosynthetic photon flux, cultivation area cover and air humidity on lettuce transpiration, using literature research and experiments. Results demonstrate that the transpiration rate was accurately simulated for the aforementioned effects. Thereafter we quantify and discuss the energy productivity of a standardised plant factory and illustrate the importance of transpiration as a design parameter for climatisation. Our model can provide a greater insight into the energetic expenditure and performance of closed systems. Consequently, it can provide a starting point for determining the viability and optimisation of plant factories. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Conventional light sources have been successfully used to cultivate a wide variety of horticultural crops. However, they are of limited use due to uncontrollability of spectra and energy inefficiency. Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) emerged with tremendous potential in controlled environment agriculture due to their energy efficiency, longevity, and spectral specificity, but the effects of different types of LEDs on plant growth and development must be examined. In this study, cucumber (Cucumis sativus L. cv. Zhongnong 26) seedlings were grown under four different lighting treatments that each delivered a photosynthetic photon flux density of 200 mu mol/m(2).s at plant canopy including triphosphate fluorescent lamps (TF), high-frequency fluorescent lamps (HF), white LEDs (WL), and red and blue LEDs (RBL). Cucumber seedlings were grown in a growth chamber at (25.0 +/- 1.5)degrees C with 12-hour light and 12-hour dark for 30 days after sowing, and data were subsequently collected. Seedlings grown under the WL were 45%, 12%, and 40% taller than those grown under the TF, HF and RBL, respectively. The leaf area was 23% smaller under the TF than under the HF. The shoot dry weight was 16%-22% lower under the TF than under the other lighting treatments. The transplants grown under the RBL had the lowest root dry weight and root to shoot ratio. The seedling quality index was similar among all the lighting treatments. The LEDs treatment yielded more total dry weight with unit electric power compared to the fluorescent lamps. The chlorophyll content was 13%-15% higher in plants grown under the HF and WL than that under the TF and RBL. Plants grown under the WL and RBL had greater photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate, and stomatal conductance than those grown under the TF and HF. It was concluded that high quality cucumber seedlings can be efficiently produced under the broad-spectrum WL that emit a reasonable amount of blue, green and red light, and the lack of green light and/or high ratio of red to blue light under the RBL may cause undesired plant attributes.

AB  - The spectrum of light affects both the electrical energy consumption by plants and photosynthetic efficiency. In a plant factory, where light-emitting diodes (LEDs) serve as an alternative to solar light, the optimal spectrum of light should be carefully chosen to maximize the rate of photosynthesis and the electrical energy efficiency of the crop. The objectives of this study were to investigate the photosynthetic rate of different colored lettuces (reddish and green leaves), to quantify the spectral dependence of photosynthetic efficiency, and to optimize the LED spectrum for maximum canopy photosynthesis and electrical energy consumption in lettuce grown in a plant factory. Two lettuce cultivars (Lactuca sativa L.), 'JeokChukMyeon' and 'CheongChukMyeon', were assessed for light absorption and photosynthetic efficiency at the single leaf and canopy levels, and the relative consumption of electrical energy from the LED lights was measured at 18 narrow wavelength bands of 10 nm from 400 to 700 nm. Anthocyanin and chlorophyll content (SPAD value) were measured and correlated with leaf color. Light interception by the canopy was estimated with light transmittance models. The light absorption was similar among the green and reddish lettuce cultivars at most wavelengths, but slightly higher in the reddish leaves around 550 nm (green region). In the reddish leaves, photosynthetic rates per incident photon of a single leaf had two peaks at 650-660 and 400-410 nm, while the photosynthetic rate per absorbed photon had three peaks at 650-660, 400-410, and 540-560 nm. In the green region of the light spectrum, both photosynthetic rates per incident photon and those per absorbed photon were lower in the reddish cultivars than in the green cultivars. The spectral dependence of light absorption at the canopy level was much weaker than that at the single leaf level. The quantum yield and absorption of green light at the canopy level were nearly same as those of blue and red lights, indicating that the photosynthetic efficiency of green light at the canopy level was higher than that at the single leaf level. The relative electrical energy consumption was lower in the green region than in the red and blue regions. Therefore, the photosynthetic efficiency based on electrical energy consumption at the canopy level was much lower with green LEDs than with blue or red LEDs. These results describe the plant response to the light spectrum at the canopy level and can be useful for optimizing artificial lighting sources for maximum plant productivity and energy-savings in a plant factory.

AB  - This study aimed to determine the effect of changes in light quality on the improvement of growth and bioactive compound synthesis in red-leaf lettuce (Lactuca sativa L. 'Sunmang') grown in a plant factory with electrical lighting. Lettuce seedlings were subjected to 12 light treatments combining five lighting sources: red (R; 655 nm), blue (B; 456 nm), and different ratios of red and blue light combined with three light-emitting diodes [LEDs (R9B1, R8B2, and R6B4)]. Treatments were divided into control (continuous irradiation of each light source for 4 weeks), monochromatic (changing from R to B at 1, 2, or 3 weeks after the onset of the experiments), and combined (changing from R9B1 to R8B2 or R6B4 at 2 or 3 weeks after the onset of the experiments). Growth and photosynthetic rates of lettuce increased with increasing ratios of red light, whereas chlorophyll and antioxidant phenolic content decreased with increasing ratios of red light. Individual phenolic compounds, including chlorogenic, caffeic, chicoric, and ferulic acids, and kaempferol, showed a similar trend to that of total phenolics. Moreover, transcript levels of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) and chalcone synthase (CHS) genes were rapidly upregulated by changing light quality from red to blue. Although the concentration of bioactive compounds in lettuce leaves enhanced with blue light, their contents per lettuce plant were more directly affected by red light, suggesting that biomass as well as bioactive compounds' accumulation should be considered to enhance phytochemical production. In addition, results suggested that growth and antioxidant phenolic compound synthesis were more sensitive to monochromatic light than to combined light variations. In conclusion, the adjustment of light quality at a specific growth stage should be considered as a strategic tool for improving crop yield, nutritional quality, or both in a plant factory with electrical lighting.

AB  - Providing healthy food for the world's growing urban population is a recognized global challenge and it is likely that current modes of conventional, large-scale farming will over time be increasingly complemented by local, urban farming practices. Apart from its acknowledged social benefits, urban farming is also widely viewed as a more resource-efficient alternative to conventional remote farming. Especially indoor, soilless cultivation in urban areas is being portrayed as a particularly sustainable solution. However, as this technique relies on controlled environments, its ongoing operation can be quite energy intensive and related carbon emissions should be carefully weighed against reduced emissions, such as those from transportation. To further this goal, this article presents a simulation-based environmental analysis workflow for Building-Integrated Agriculture (BIA) in urban contexts, that includes detailed solar radiation, water and energy specific models. The aim of the workflow is to guide the User through decision-making on the potentialities of implementing BIA in a given neighborhood while maximizing crop yields and minimizing water and energy consumption. The workflow was applied to three hi-tech urban farming scenarios in Lisbon, Portugal: a polycarbonate Rooftop Greenhouse (RG), a Vertical Farm (VF) with windows and skylights on the top floor of a reinforced-concrete building as well as a completely opaque VF with no penetration of natural light on the ground floor of a reinforced-concrete building. Global Warming Potential (GWP) related to water, transportation and operational energy of these three case studies were compared to GWP of (i) the currently existing supply chain for tomato, and (ii) a hypothetical low-tech unconditioned rooftop urban farm. Results show that the RG and the top floor VF had the best overall environmental performance, respectively cutting greenhouse gas emissions in half and in three in comparison with the existing supply chain for tomato. By allowing this preliminary assessment of alternative farm locations and properties, the workflow provides the user with actionable information for early-stage holistic assessment of BIA projects.

AB  - Harsh weather conditions in Oman curbs open-field cultivation of high-value vegetable crops. Greenhouse cultivation presents a promising solution to overcome these conditions. This paper presents the status of controlled-environment agriculture in Oman and highlights the associated mechanization potentials. It was reported that greenhouse population increases swiftly due to the subsidy program implemented by the government. Greenhouse cultivation increased water and land productivity by 2 and 12 times, respectively. The dominant crop cultivated in greenhouses is cucumber (90%) followed by tomatoes (5-9%). Other crops such as beans, capsicums, strawberry, raspberry and melons are also cultivated. Although the main purpose of greenhouses is crop cultivation, other applications such as poultry production, growth chambers, solar drying and saline water desalination are also practiced. Single-span Quonset-type greenhouses are the most popular greenhouses (89%) while double- and multi-span greenhouses are less popular (11%). The majority of greenhouses are covered with polyethylene films but some farmers started shifting to polycarbonate cladding due to its long-lasting and thermal insulation properties. For environmental control, fan-pad evaporative coolers are used to reduce ambient temperatures. Natural ventilation is only practiced in high tech-greenhouses. Other mechanisms such as shading and painting with reflective materials are implemented to reduce light transmission. Soil-based cultivation practice is more popular (97%) as compared with hydroponic systems (3%). The seasonal profitability of cucumber and tomato crops is USD 744 and 369 per greenhouse, respectively. The use of machinery in greenhouses is very weak due to the limited access inside Quonset greenhouses. However, small-size machinery such as mini- and medium-size tillers are used.

AB  - Adding green component to growth light had a profound effect on biomass accumulation in lettuce. However, conflicting views on photosynthetic efficiency of green light, which have been reported, might occur due to nonuniform light sources used in previous studies. In an attempt to reveal plausible mechanisms underlying the differential photosynthetic and developmental responses to green light, we established a new way of light treatment modeled according to the principle of gene "knock out". Lettuce (Lactuca sativa L. var. youmaicai) was grown under two different light spectra, including a wide spectrum of light-emitting diode (LED) light (CK) and a wide spectrum LED light lacking green (480-560 nm) (LG). Total PPFD was approximately 100 A mu mol(photon) m(-2) s(-1) for each light source. As compared to lettuce grown under CK, shoot dry mass, photosynthetic pigment contents, total chlorophyll to carotenoids ratio, absorptance of PPFD, and CO2 assimilation showed a remarkable decrease under LG, although specific leaf area did not show significant difference. Furthermore, plants grown under LG showed significantly lower stomatal conductance, intercellular CO2 concentration, and transpiration compared with CK. The plants under CK exhibited significantly higher intrinsic quantum efficiency, respiration rate, saturation irradiance, and obviously lower compensation irradiance. Finally, we showed that the maximum ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate-saturated rate of carboxylation, the maximum rate of electron transport, and rate of triosephosphate utilization were significantly reduced by LG. These results highlighted the influence of green light on photosynthetic responses under the conditions used in this study. Adding green component (480-560 nm) to growth light affected biomass accumulation of lettuce in controllable environments, such as plant factory and Bioregenerative Life Support System.

AB  - Carbon dioxide (CO2), nutrient supply, and light quality are amongst the major controlling factors to improve the biomass production and nutritional outputs in plant factory. The present study employed CE-MS to investigate the effects of high CO2, nutrient formulation, and LED on the accumulation of primary metabolites in head lettuce. Results suggested that high CO2 (1000 ppm) and nutrient supply enhanced both the biomass and some amino acids. Hierarchical clustering analysis was used to evaluate effects of red LED in combination with high CO2 and Hoagland's formulation; distinctive cluster formation contained 14 amino acids (mostly branched-chain and aromatic amino acids, histidine and arginine). Thus, simultaneous treatments of monochromatic LED, high CO2 and nutrient formulation improved the amino acids accumulation, and likely reduced the inorganic nitrogen sources in planta.

AB  - Mechanical stimuli or stress has been shown to induce characteristic morphogenic responses (thigmomorphogenesis) in a range of crop species. The typical mechanically stimulated phenotype is shorter and more compact than non-mechanically stimulated plants. This dwarfing effect can be employed to help conform crop plants to the constraints of spaceflight and vertical agriculture crop production systems. Capsicum annum (cv. California Wonder) plants were grown in controlled environment chambers and subjected to mechanical stimulation in the form of firm but gentle daily rubbing of internode tissue with a tightly wrapped cotton swab. Two studies were conducted, the first being a vegetative growth phase study in which plants were mechanically stimulated until anthesis. The second study carried the mechanical stimulation through to fruit set. The response during the vegetative growth experiment was consistent with other results in the literature, with a general reduction in all plant growth metrics and an increase in relative chlorophyll (SPAD) content under mechanical stimulation. In the fruiting phase study, only height and stem thickness differed from the control plants. Using the data from the fruiting study, a rudimentary calculation of volume use efficiency (VUE) improvements was conducted. Results suggest that VUE can be improved, particularly in terrestrial vertical agriculture systems that can take advantage of moderate height reductions by exploiting much greater vertical capacity in the production system. Mechanical stimulation can also improve VUE in spaceflight applications by reducing vertical system requirements or by expanding the species range that can be grown in a fixed production volume. Mechanical stimulation is also discussed as a microgravity countermeasure for crop plants.

AB  - Light intensity and nitrogen concentration of nutrient solution are considered crucial for the contents of vitamin C and nitrate in cultivated leaf vegetables. We here investigated the effects of various combinations of light intensity (60,140 and 220 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) and nitrogen concentration (7,15 and 23 mmol L-1) of the solution on the growth, photosynthetic characteristics, vitamin C and nitrate content of lettuce. Our results demonstrate that the lettuce had the largest dry biomass at the high illumination of 220 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) and low nitrogen of 7 mmol L-1. The higher light and low nitrogen also contributed to the accumulation of vitamin C and decrease of nitrate in lettuce leaves. The effect of nitrogen supply on chlorophyll concentrations was more efficient under low light than high illumination. Our results reveal that there was an obvious interaction between light intensity and nitrogen available for the photosynthesis, yield and quality of lettuce. This study provides valuable insights into the combinational regulation of light intensity and nitrogen supply for improving growth and nutritional quality of vegetables grown in greenhouse and plant factory.

AB  - In 2050, Mexico's population will reach 150 million people, about 80% of whom will likely live in urban centers. This increase in population will necessitate increased food production in the country. The lands classified as drylands in Mexico occupy approximately 101.5 million hectares, or just over half the territory, limiting the potential for agricultural expansion. In addition to the problem of arid conditions in Mexico, there are conditions in other parts of the country related to low to very low water availability, resulting in pressure on the water resources in almost two-thirds of the country. Currently, agriculture uses 77% of the water withdrawn, primarily for food production. This sector contributes 12% of the total greenhouse gas emission (GHG) production in the country. Given the conditions of pressure on water and land resources in Mexico and the need to reduce the carbon footprint, vertical farming technology could offer the possibility for sustainable food production in the urban areas of the country in the coming years.

AB  - Purpose - The UN statistics show that the world's population is expected to be nine billion by the 2050. As a result, the food production must also be raised to 70 per cent or more. Vertical farming (VF) is an innovative and alternative approach to meet the challenges; however, its management will also be a challenge. This paper, therefore, shares the understanding of future food challenges and Building Information Modelling (BIM) and its application to manage the facility.
   Design/methodology/approach - A conceptual digital prototype of a VF is developed in a BIM environment using design science. First, the data are collected from literature review and then analysed and simulated for optimum conditions in a BIM-enabled digital prototype.
   Findings - The results showed that BIM to manage a VF has not been researched or explored yet. However, BIM has proven its numerous benefits to the architecture, engineering and construction and facility management industries, and it is a powerful solution to design and manage VF to solve future food production problems.
   Originality/value - There is a very limited research on VF in the literature, and BIM for VF is also not discussed or researched yet. The originality and value of this research stems from both expanding BIM horizons and designing and managing VF.

AB  - The development of controlled environment agriculture techniques such as hydroponics offers a viable alternative to obtain a high efficiency in water use and higher productivity in an environmentally sustainable way. A study was undertaken to assess the feasibility of growing Mentha spicata under hydroponic conditions and to compare its biochemical properties with that of soil-grown plants. The results confirmed that the productivity of M. spicata was higher in terms of crop biometric properties, yield and its influence on the biochemical properties. The per cent yield in M. spicata was 61% higher than the conventional soil farming. The antioxidant activity, enzyme activity and active compounds present in the plant extracts and presence of organic acids were higher in hydroponically grown plants when compared to the soilgrown plants. Similarly, the higher value of phenol and proline in soil-grown plants when compared to hydroponic plants indicated that the plants were subjected to some form of abiotic and biotic stress. Hence, it is suggested that the cultivation of these medicinal plants under hydroponic condition is a viable alternative in urban and peri-urban areas and avoids the problems that are characteristic in conventional cultivation of these plants.

AB  - Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are widely used for artificial lighting in plant factories and have been applied for disease prevention and for accelerating plant growth. In this study, a unique dual-emitting core-shell CDs/CaAlSiN3: Eu2+-silica powder was prepared by a one-pot sol-gel method. LED devices with multiwavelength emission (623 nm red light and 465 nm blue light) were fabricated using the as-prepared dual-emitting core-shell CDs/CaAlSiN3: Eu2+-silica powder, and the electrical characteristics of these LED devices were evaluated. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that these LED devices could be used for plant growth lighting in plant factories. The LEDs prepared in the present study for plant growth lighting have the advantage of being convenient, low-cost, non-toxic, and stable compared with traditional LED devices for plant growth lighting.

AB  - Quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Willd.) is a grain crop with high nutritional value. The leaves and sprouts of quinoa can also be consumed either raw or cooked, providing considerably nutritional value as well as high antioxidant and anticancer activities. This study was carried out to obtain basic data to assist in the practical design of a plant factory with artificial lighting for the cultivation of quinoa as a leafy vegetable. We estimated the energy content of the quinoa and the electrical energy required to produce this crop. The yield was 1,000 plants per day, with a planting density and light intensity of 0.015 m(2) (15 x 10 cm) and 200 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1), respectively. The total number of plants, cultivation area, and electricity consumption were estimated to be 25,000, 375 m2, and 93,750 mu mol.s(-1), respectively. White fluorescent lamps were used at a power of 20.4 kW from 1,857 fluorescent lamps (FL, 55 W), and the cost for electricity was approximately 1,820 dollars (exchange rate of $1 = 1,200 won) per month. For a daily harvest of 1,000 plants per day in a closed plant factory, the estimated light installation cost, total installation cost, and total production cost would be 15,473, 46,421, and 55,704 dollars, respectively. The calculated production cost per plant, including labor costs, would be 27 cents for the 25-day cultivation period, with a marketable ratio of 80%. Considering the annual total expenses, income, and depreciation costs, the selling price per plant was estimated to be approximately 56 cents.

AB  - Current LED-based artificial lights for crop cultivation consist of red and blue lights because these spectra effectively promote leaf photosynthesis. However, the absence of green light could be disadvantageous for crop production, as green light plays an important role in plant development. The objective of this study was to investigate whether adding green light to different proportions of red and blue light would affect the leaf photosynthetic rate, growth, and morphology of lettuce plants. Plants were transplanted and grown hydroponically for 25 days under different combinations of red, blue (0, 10, 20, and 30%), and green (0 and 10%) light at 150 +/- 15 mu molaEuro cent m(-2)aEuro cent s(-1) of photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD). The leaf photosynthetic rate was highest under 80% red and 20% blue light and decreased significantly with the addition of green light and the absence of blue light. As the fraction of blue light increased, leaf size and plant growth decreased significantly. However, while the addition of green light considerably reduced the leaf photosynthetic rate, it did not reduce plant growth. In the absence of blue light, the plants showed symptoms of the shade avoidance response, which possibly enhanced their growth by improving their light interception. Therefore, the addition of 10% (15 mu molaEuro cent m(-2)aEuro cent s(-1)) green light did not have a positive effect on the growth of lettuce. Further study using higher intensities of green light is required to investigate the effects of green light on plant growth.

AB  - Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are currently undergoing rapid development as plant growth light sources in a plant factory with artificial lighting (PFAL). However, little is known about the effects of supplementary light and pulsed LEDs on plant growth, bioactive compound productions, and energy efficiency in lettuce. In this study, we aimed to determine the effects of supplementary white LEDs (study I) and pulsed LEDs (study II) on red leaf lettuce (Lactuca sativa L. 'Sunmang'). In study I, six LED sources were used to determine the effects of supplementary white LEDs (RGB 7:1:1, 7:1:2, RWB 7:1:2, 7:2:1, 8:1:1, 8:2:0 [based on chip number] on lettuce). Fluorescent lamps were used as the control. In study II, pulsed RWB 7:2:1 LED treatments (30, 10, 1 kHz with a 50 or 75% duty ratio) were applied to lettuce. In study I, the application of red and blue fractions improved plant growth characteristics and the accumulation of antioxidant phenolic compounds, respectively. In addition, the application of green light increased plant growth, including the fresh and dry weights of shoots and roots, as well as leaf area. However, the substitution of green LEDs with white LEDs induced approximately 3.4-times higher light and energy use efficiency. In study II, the growth characteristics and photosynthesis of lettuce were affected by various combinations of duty ratio and frequency. In particular, biomass under a 1 kHz 75% duty ratio of pulsed LEDs was not significantly different from that of the control (continuous LEDs). Moreover, no significant difference in leaf photosynthetic rate was observed between any pulsed LED treatment utilizing a 75% duty ratio versus continuous LEDs. However, some pulsed LED treatments may potentially improve light and energy use efficiency compared to continuous LEDs. These results suggest that the fraction of red, blue, and green wavelengths of LEDs is an important factor for plant growth and the biosynthesis of bioactive compounds in lettuce and that supplementary white LEDs (based on a combination of red and blue LEDs) might be more suitable as a commercial lighting source than green LEDs. In addition, the use of suitable pulses of LEDs might save energy while inducing plant growth similar to that under continuous LEDs. Our findings provide important basic information for designing optimal light sources for use in a PFAL.

AB  - Tipburn is a physiological disorder caused by a calcium (Ca) deficiency that occurs mainly in leafy vegetables, such as lettuce, resulting in a reduced commercial value. To prevent tipburn injury, a sensitive cultivar was tested as an indicator for early symptom detection. An indicator cultivar began to develop tipburn two days earlier than the target cultivar. This allowed for the rescue of the target cultivar by the addition of extra Ca. The yield rate was improved from 4% to 70% with the use of an indicator cultivar in the hydroponic cultures. The top fresh weight of the target cultivar when using an indicator cultivar decreased compared with control plants, but increased compared with negative control plants lacking Ca in the culture. Water contents and root lengths were not affected by the use of an indicator cultivar and additional Ca. These results were consistent with other target cultivars under excess ammonium conditions. This system may be used against tipburn incidence without additional costs and equipment in plant factories. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Photosynthetic models of crops are essential for predicting the optimum CO2 concentrations that should be maintained for crop productivity in closed systems throughout the growth period. The objective of this study was to develop a canopy photosynthetic model of romaine lettuce (Lactuca sativa L., cv. Asia Heuk romaine) incorporating CO2 concentration and plant growth stage. The canopy photosynthetic rates of the plants were measured 4, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days after transplanting using closed acrylic chambers, in which the temperature was maintained at 24A degrees C and a 200 A mu mol center dot m (-2) center dot s(-1) light intensity was provided by an 8:1:1 ratio of RBW light-emitting diodes. The canopy photosynthetic rate of the lettuce was calculated by measuring the reduction in CO2 within the chamber over time, from an initial concentration of 2,000 A mu mol center dot mol (-1). The canopy photosynthetic rate became saturated as the CO2 concentration increased, while it exponentially decreased with the plant growth stage. Among the previously published models available, the Thornley model was suitable for the expression of the canopy photosynthetic rate; however, it had to be adapted to take into account growth stage, resulting in an R-2 of 0.985. The canopy photosynthetic rates estimated by the models showed good agreement with those actually measured (R-2 = 0.939). Based on these results, the established model may be helpful in determining the optimum level of CO2 required for crop production and in calculating the decreasing CO2 requirements throughout the cultivation period.

AB  - The medicinal plant Crepidiastrum denticulatum, which is found throughout East Asia, contains various health-promoting phytochemicals. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of a newly developed nutrient solution (referred to as NSC) on the growth of this plant and to determine the proper EC level of NSC for stable phytochemical production in plant factories. Three-week-old seedlings were transplanted to a wick culture system supplied with Hoagland solution (EC 1.0 dS center dot m (-1)) as a control or with five different concentrations of NSC (EC 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 dS center dot m (-1)). We grew the plants under normal conditions (20A degrees C, 310 +/- 10 A mu mol center dot m (-2)center dot s (-1) PPF, CO2 1,000 A mu mol center dot mol (-1), and a 16 hours photoperiod) for 6 weeks and evaluated their photosynthetic rates and growth characteristics, such as the fresh and dry weights of shoots and roots, leaf area, number of leaves, and S/R ratios, at 6 weeks after transplanting. We also measured the total phenolic content, antioxidant capacity, and chicoric acid content each week for 6 weeks after transplanting. The fresh weights of shoots and roots, leaf area, and number of leaves significantly increased in plants supplied with 2.0 and 2.5 dS center dot m (-1) NSC compared with the control, while the photosynthetic rate did not change under different concentrations of NSC. The total phenolic content and antioxidant capacity per shoot significantly increased with increasing in EC level of NSC; this trend became more pronounced over time. Moreover, the chicoric acid content significantly increased during growth up to 6 weeks after transplanting. These results suggest that NSC increases the biomass of C. denticulatum and that an EC level of 2.0 or 2.5 dS center dot m (-1) is proper for accumulating high levels of phytochemicals, such as chicoric acid, in C. denticulatum grown in plant factories.

AB  - The grow-cell belongs to a relatively new category of plant factory in the horticultural industry, for which the motivation is the maximization of production and the minimization of energy consumption. This article takes a systems design approach to identify the engineering requirements of a new grow-cell facility, with the prototype based on a 12 m x 2.4 m x 2.5 m shipping container. Research contributions are made in respect to: (i) the design of a novel conveyor-irrigation system for mechanical movement of plants; (ii) tuning of the artificial light source for plant growth; and (iii) investigations into the environmental conditions inside the grow-cell, including the temperature and humidity. In particular, the conveyor-irrigation and lighting systems are optimised in this article to make the proposed grow-cell more effective and sustainable. With regard to micro-climate, data are collected from a distributed sensor array to provide improved understanding of the heterogeneous conditions arising within the grow-cell, with a view to future optimisation. Preliminary growth trials demonstrate that Begonia semperflorens can be harvested to the satisfaction of a commercial grower. In future research, the prototype unit thus developed can be used to investigate production rates, plant quality and whole system operating costs. (C) 2016 The Authors.

AB  - Tipburn is a severe problem in producing butterhead lettuce under artificial lighting and develops as a consequence of decreased calcium concentrations in leaves. Here, we investigated the effects of light intensity on tipburn development and calcium concentration in leaves by comparing their growth rates. Butterhead lettuce was grown in a plant factory under artificial light at photosynthetic photon flux (PPF) densities of 150, 200, 250, and 300 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1). Fresh and dry weights of shoots, relative growth rate, the number of leaves, and the number of tipburned leaves significantly increased with light intensity. Associations existed between growth and tipburn occurrence. Calcium absorption rate per plant also increased with light intensity in association with increased water absorption rate. Consequently, calcium concentrations in the entire plant and outer leaves increased with light intensity. In contrast, calcium concentration in the inner enclosed leaves did not increase with light intensity. This pattern can be attributed to the higher mass flow of calcium to outer leaves than to inner leaves, driven by transpiration, under high light intensities. Thus, a lack of calcium in the inner leaves resulting from rapid growth may contribute to the frequent tipburn development.

The plants were grown under continuous lighting using three types of blue and red LEDs (blue light peak wavelength: 405, 450, and 470 nm; red light peak wavelength: 630, 660, and 685 nm) during the nursery period. All blue light from the various peak LED types promoted more flowering compared with red light (630 and 660 nm except for 685 nm). The longer wavelength among the red light range positively correlated with earlier flowering, whereas the number of days to anthesis did not significantly differ among blue LED treatment wavelengths, irrespective of peak wavelength. The result of a similar experiment using the perpetual flowering Fragaria vesca accession Hawaii-4 representing a model strawberry species showed almost the same pattern of flowering response to light quality. These results suggest that long-day strawberry plants show similar flowering response to light quality. The photosynthetic rate under red light (660 nm) was higher than that under blue light (450 nm). However, the plants grown under red light showed lower photosynthetic capacity than those grown under blue light. Although the light color used to grow the seedlings showed no difference in the daily fruit production, blue light irradiation during the nursery period hastened harvesting because of the advance in flowering.

AB  - We investigated the effects of light quality during night interruption (NI) on morphogenesis, flowering, and the transcription of photoreceptor genes in Petunia hybrida Hort. 'Easy Wave Pink' (a qualitative long-day plant, LDP). Plants were grown in a closed-type plant factory under a constant light intensity of 180 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1) PPF provided by white (W) light emitting diodes (LEDs) under long day (LD, 16 h light/8 h dark), short day (SD, 10 h light/14 h dark), or SD conditions with a 4 h NI using green (NI-G), blue (NI-B), red (NI-R), far-red (NI-Fr), or white (NI-W) LEDs at an intensity of 10 mu mol.m-2.s-1 PPF. Shoot length was greatest under NI-Fr. Flowering was observed under LD, NI-G, NI-Fr, and NI-W. The expression of photoreceptor genes was induced by NI. Specifically, phyA, phyB, and cry1 were more highly expressed under NI-G, NI-B, and NI-R compared to LD and SD. These results suggest that morphogenesis, flowering, and transcriptional factors are strongly affected by light quality during NI.

AB  - Vertical farming systems (VFS) have been proposed as an engineering solution to increase productivity per unit area of cultivated land by extending crop production into the vertical dimension. To test whether this approach presents a viable alternative to horizontal crop production systems, a VFS (where plants were grown in upright cylindrical columns) was compared against a conventional horizontal hydroponic system (HHS) using lettuce (Lactuca sativa L. cv. Little Gem) as a model crop. Both systems had similar root zone volume and planting density. Half-strength Hoagland's solution was applied to plants grown in perlite in an indoor controlled environment room, with metal halide lamps providing artificial lighting. Light distribution (photosynthetic photon flux density, PPFD) and yield (shoot fresh weight) within each system were assessed. Although PPFD and shoot fresh weight decreased significantly in the VFS from top to base, the VFS produced more crop per unit of growing floor area when compared with the HHS. Our results clearly demonstrate that VFS presents an attractive alternative to horizontal hydroponic growth systems and suggest that further increases in yield could be achieved by incorporating artificial lighting in the VFS.

AB  - A light-mixing module consisting of a compound parabolic concentrator (CPC) and a fiber for mixing light from red, green, blue, and white (RGBW) LEDs was proposed. The design principle was investigated and a design prototype was demonstrated in a simulation. The simulated results showed that the chromatic nonuniformity was reduced to 1/10 when the fiber length was 40 times the core width, and the module efficiencies were more than 80% and more than 60% when the fiber lengths were 350mm and 5m, respectively. The proposed module is suitable for solar lighting compensation or indoor lighting, such as plant-factory lighting. (C) 2016 The Japan Society of Applied Physics

AB  - Although, the circadian clock is a universal biological system in plants and it orchestrates important role of plant production such as photosynthesis, floral induction and growth, there are few such studies on cultivated species. Lettuce is one major cultivated species for both open culture and plant factories and there is little information concerning its circadian clock system. In addition, most of the relevant genes have not been identified. In this study, we detected circadian oscillation in the lettuce transcriptome using time-course RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data. Constant light (LL) and light dark (LD) conditions were used to detect circadian oscillation because the circadian clock has some basic properties: one is self-sustaining oscillation under constant light and another is entrainment to environmental cycles such as light and temperature. In the results, 215 contigs were detected as common oscillating contigs under both LL and LD conditions. The 215 common oscillating contigs included clock gene like contigs CCA1 (CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1)-like, TOC1 (TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION 1) like and LHY (LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL)-like, and their expression patterns were similar to those of Arabiclopsis. Functional enrichment analysis by GO (gene ontology) Slim and GO Fat showed that the GO terms of response to light stimulus, response to stress, photosynthesis and circadian rhythms were enriched in the 215 common oscillating contigs and these terms were actually regulated by circadian clocks in plants. The 215 common oscillating contigs can be used to evaluate whether the gene expression pattern related to photosynthesis and optical response performs normally in lettuce.

AB  - Indoor plant factories are one of the alternative ways to meet the demands of food production for the increased urban dwellers. It enables growers to grow food crops consistently and locally with high quality. In an indoor plant factory, a forced convection based ventilation and circulation system is used to control the growing environment and maintain climate uniformity. Lettuce is a common leafy crop grown in indoor plant factories and an improper design could cause the tip burn of lettuces which usually occurs at inner and newly developing leaves with low transpiration rate due to the existence of a stagnant boundary layer under high transpiration demand. A three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was developed and validated through simulating the growing environment in a single shelf production system. An improved air circulation system was designed and proposed to help providing a dynamic and uniform boundary layer which could help preventing tip bum occurrences in lettuce production. A perforated air tube with three rows of air jets was designed to provide vertical air flow down to the crop canopy surface. Four cases with the perforated air tubes were compared with a control treatment. The results indicated that the case with two perforated air tubes was able to provide an average air velocity of 0.42 m s(-1) with a coefficient of variation of 44%, which was recommended as the optimal design of air circulation system among four cases in this study.

AB  - Quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Willd.) is a plant native to the Andean region that has become increasing popular as a food source due to its high nutritional content. This study determined the optimal photoperiod, light intensity, and electrical conductivity (EC) of the nutrient solution for growth and yield of quinoa in a closed-type plant factory system. The photoperiod effects were first analyzed in a growth chamber using three different light cycles, 8/16, 14/10, and 16/8 hours (day/night). Further studies, performed in a closed-type plant factory system, evaluated nutrient solutions with EC (salinity) levels of 1.0, 2.0 or 3.0 dS.m(-1). These experiments were assayed with two light intensities (120 and 143 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1)) under a 12/12 and 14/10 hours (day/night) photoperiod. The plants grown under the 16/8 hours photoperiod did not flower, suggesting that a long-day photoperiod delays flowering and that quinoa is a short-day plant. Under a 12/12 h photoperiod, the best shoot yield (both fresh and dry weights) was observed at an EC of 2.0 dS.m(-1) and a photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) of 120 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1). With a 14/10 h photoperiod, the shoot yield (both fresh and dry weights), plant height, leaf area, and light use efficiency were higher when grown with an EC of 2.0 dS.m(-1) and a PPFD of 143 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1). Overall, the optimal conditions for producing quinoa as a leafy vegetable, in a closed-type plant factory system, were a 16/8 h (day/night) photoperiod with an EC of 2.0 dS.m(-1) and a PPFD of 143 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1).

AB  - When designing a plant production system, it is crucial to perform advanced estimation of growth and productivity in relation to cultivation factors. In this study, we developed Planting-density Growth Harvest (PGH) charts to facilitate the estimation of crop growth and harvest factors such as growth rate, relative growth rate, shoot fresh weight, harvesting time, marketable rate, and marketable yield for quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Willd.) and sowthistle (Ixeris dentata Nakai). The plants were grown in a nutrient film technique (NFT) system in a closed-type plant factory under fluorescent lamps with three-band radiation under a light intensity of 140 mu mol center dot m(-2) center dot s(-1), with a 12-h/12-h (day/night) photoperiod. We analyzed the growth and yield of quinoa and sowthistle grown in nutrient solution at EC 2.0 dS center dot m(-1) under four planting densities: 15 cm between rows with a within-row distance of 15 x 10 cm (67 plants/m (2)), 15 x 15 cm (44 plants/m(2)), 15 x 20 cm (33 plants/m(2)), and 15 x 25 cm (27 plants/m(2)). Crop growth rate, relative growth rate, and lost time were closely correlated with planting density. We constructed PGH charts based on the growth data and existing models. Using these charts, growth factors could easily be determined, including growth rate, relative growth rate, and lost time, as well as harvest factors such as shoot fresh weight, marketable yield per area, and harvesting time, based on at least two parameters, for instance, planting density and shoot fresh weight.

AB  - Greece is currently in a turmoil, experiencing the effects of more than half a decade of economic crisis. Public health and welfare, jobs and wages, labor market concerning employment as long as employability of the work force, inequality, life satisfaction and housing, tourism and environment, economic and energy poverty are heavily impacted by Greece's disadvantageous economic situation. Real estate market could not have gotten away from the financial commotion, being currently in a halt after years of rapid decline. Fired from the present situation of Greece's real estate market, the present study is concerned with the investigation of alternative ways to support the local real estate market. With respect to sustainable development's ethics, the development, implementation, installation and operation of small, inexpensive plant factories within the urban environment is evaluated. Installations such are those, will encourage the penetration of a new market for the untapped buildings' resource, advancing new investing opportunities, promoting economic growth and productivity while creating a new labor market. The study will rely on the basic principles of Life Cycle Costing Assessment and develop a methodology upon which different scenarios will be evaluated against the "Do Nothing" scenario.

AB  - Strawberry is being promoted for year round production due to its highly desirable taste, flavour and health properties, and it is possible through soilless cultivation. A study on production of strawberry cv. Festival under vertical growth system with four tiers on soilless medium in a passively ventilated greenhouse was attempted. Significant differences were observed for the growth parameters, viz., number of leaves, leaf area, crown diameter and biomass production. Of the four tiers, first tier planting tended to show the enhanced plant growth and photosynthesis rate with early flowering, higher fruit yield of improved fruit quality than lower tiers tested.

AB  - Crop cultivation in controlled environment plant factories offers great potential to stabilize the yield and quality of agricultural products. However, many crops are currently unsuited to these environments, particularly closed cultivation systems, due to space limitations, low light intensity, high implementation costs, and high energy requirements. A major barrier to closed system cultivation is the high running cost, which necessitates the use of high-margin crops for economic viability. High-value crops include those with enhanced nutritional value or containing additional functional components for pharmaceutical production or with the aim of providing health benefits. In addition, it is important to develop cultivars equipped with growth parameters that are suitable for closed cultivation. Small plant size is of particular importance due to the limited cultivation space. Other advantageous traits are short production cycle, the ability to grow under low light, and high nutriculture availability. Cost-effectiveness is improved from the use of cultivars that are specifically optimized for closed system cultivation. This review describes the features of closed cultivation systems and the potential application of molecular breeding to create crops that are optimized for cost-effectiveness and productivity in closed cultivation systems.

AB  - The common ice plant (Mesembryanthemum crystallinum L.) has some medicinal uses and recommended plant in closed-type plant factory. The objective of this study was to estimate the cardinal temperatures for seed germination of the common ice plant using bilinear, parabolic, and beta distribution models. Seeds of the common ice plant were germinated in the dark in a growth chamber at four constant temperatures: 16, 20, 24, and 28 degrees C. For this, four replicates of 100 seeds were placed on two layers of filter paper in a 9-cm petri dish and radicle emergence of 0.1 mm was scored as germination. The times to 50% germination were 4.3, 2.5, 2.0, and 1.8 days at 16, 20, 24, and 28 degrees C, respectively, indicating that the germination of this warm weather crop increased with temperature. Next, the time course of germination was modeled using a logistic function. For the selection of an accurate model, seeds were germinated in the dark at constant temperatures of 6, 12, 32, and 36 degrees C. Germination started earlier and increased rapidly at temperatures above 20 degrees C. The minimum, optimal, and maximum temperatures were estimated by regression of the inverse of time to 50% germination rate, as a function of the temperature gradient. The different functions estimated differing minimum, optimal and maximum temperatures, with 5.7, 27.7, and 36.5 degrees C, respectively for the bilinear function, 13.4, 25.0, and 36.6 degrees C, respectively, for the parabolic function and 7.8, 25.9, and 36.0 degrees C, respectively, for the beta distribution function. The models estimated that the inverse of time to 50% germination rate was 0 at 6 and 36 degrees C. The observed final germination rates at 12 and 32 degrees C were 62 and 97%, respectively. Our data show that a beta distribution function provides a useful model for estimating the cardinal temperatures for germination of seed from the common ice plant.

AB  - In plant factories, plants are usually cultivated in nutrient solution under a controllable environment. Plant quality and growth are closely monitored and precisely controlled. For plant growth evaluation, plant weight is an important and commonly used indicator. Traditional plant weight measurements are destructive and laborious. In order to measure and record the plant weight during plant growth, an automated measurement system was designed and developed herein. The weight measurement system comprises a weight measurement device and an imaging system. The weight measurement device consists of a top disk, a bottom disk, a plant holder and a load cell. The load cell with a resolution of 0.1 g converts the plant weight on the plant holder disk to an analog electrical signal for a precise measurement. The top disk and bottom disk are designed to be durable for different plant sizes, so plant weight can be measured continuously throughout the whole growth period, without hindering plant growth. The results show that plant weights measured by the weight measurement device are highly correlated with the weights estimated by the stereo-vision imaging system; hence, plant weight can be measured by either method. The weight growth of selected vegetables growing in the National Taiwan University plant factory were monitored and measured using our automated plant growth weight measurement system. The experimental results demonstrate the functionality, stability and durability of this system. The information gathered by this weight system can be valuable and beneficial for hydroponic plants monitoring research and agricultural research applications.

AB  - Poorly grown plants that result from differences in individuals lead to large profit losses for plant factories that use large electric power sources for cultivation. Thus, identifying and culling the low-grade plants at an early stage, using so-called seedlings diagnosis technology, plays an important role in avoiding large losses in plant factories. In this study, we developed a high-throughput diagnosis system using the measurement of chlorophyll fluorescence (CF) in a commercial large-scale plant factory, which produces about 5000 lettuce plants every day. At an early stage (6 days after sowing), a CF image of 7200 seedlings was captured every 4 h on the final greening day by a high-sensitivity CCD camera and an automatic transferring machine, and biological indices were extracted. Using machine learning, plant growth can be predicted with a high degree of accuracy based on biological indices including leaf size, amount of CF, and circadian rhythms in CF. Growth prediction was improved by addition of temporal information on CF The present data also provide new insights into the relationships between growth and temporal information regulated by the inherent biological clock.

AB  - The commercial use of a plant production system with artificial light (PPAL) is limited by its high initial construction and operation costs. The electric-energy consumed by heat pumps, applied mainly for cooling, accounts for 15-35% of the total electric-energy used in a PPAL. To reduce the electric-energy consumption, an air exchanger with low capacity (180 W) was used for cooling by introducing outdoor cold air. In this experiment, the indoor air temperature in two PPALs (floor area: 6.2 m(2) each) was maintained at 25 and 20 degrees C during photoperiod and dark period, respectively, for lettuce production. A null CO2 balance enrichment method was used in both PPALs. In one PPAL (PPAL(e)), an air exchanger (air flow rate: 250 m(3).h(-1)) was used along with a heat pump (cooling capacity: 3.2 kW) to maintain the indoor air temperature at the set-point. The other PPAL (PPAL(c)) with only a heat pump (cooling capacity: 3.2 kW) was used for reference. Effects of introducing outdoor cold air on energy use efficiency, coefficient of performance (COP), electric-energy consumption for cooling and growth of lettuce were investigated. The results show that: when the air temperature difference between indoor and outdoor ranged from 20.2 to 30.0 degrees C: (1) the average energy use efficiency of the air exchanger was 2.8 and 3.4 times greater than the COP of the heat pumps in the PPAL(e) and PPAL(c), respectively; (2) hourly electric-energy consumption for cooling in the PPAL(e) reduced by 15.8-73.7% compared with that in the PPAL(c); (3) daily supply of CO2 in the PPAL(e) reduced from 0.15 to 0.04 kg compared with that in the PPAL, with the outdoor air temperature ranging from -5.6 to 2.7 degrees C; (4) no significant difference in lettuce growth was observed in both PPALs. The results indicate that using air exchanger to introduce outdoor cold air should be considered as an effective way to reduce electric-energy consumption for cooling with little effects on plant growth in a PPAL.

AB  - An Android application system for the simple and real-time estimation of light intensity distribution on a plant canopy surface was developed, and its usefulness was tested under artificial lighting. The application system was designed to semi-automatically analyze the photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) distribution on the canopy from a reflection image acquired by the tablet. A single manual measurement by a quantum sensor at a point on the canopy was performed to build a regression model that estimated the PPFD on leaves from the pixel values of the image. Measured and estimated PPFD histograms, as well as parameters derived from histograms, were compared at three different growth stages of a plant canopy in a closed plant factory with artificial lighting. The measured and estimated histograms exhibited a similar pattern at each growth stage with close values of the parameters. The results suggested that the reflection-image-based estimation system developed in this study was a useful method for analyzing the light conditions under artificial lighting. Although the developed system will require additional improvements in automation and performance before it can be applied to actual cultivation management procedures, this simple method for estimating the light intensity distribution is expected to help improve the efficiency and reproducibility of light control methods used for plant production.

AB  - Year-round production in a contained, environmentally controlled plant factory' may provide a cost-effective method to produce pharmaceuticals and other high-value products. However, cost-effective production may require substantial modification of the host plant phenotype; for example, using dwarf plants can enable the growth of more plants in a given volume by allowing more plants per shelf and enabling more shelves to be stacked vertically. We show here that the expression of the chimeric repressor for Arabidopsis AtIBH1 (P35S:AtIBH1SRDX) in transgenic tobacco plants (Nicotiana tabacum) induces a dwarf phenotype, with reduced cell size. We estimate that, in a given volume of cultivation space, we can grow five times more AtIBH1SRDX plants than wild-type plants. Although, the AtIBH1SRDX plants also showed reduced biomass compared with wild-type plants, they produced about four times more biomass per unit of cultivation volume. To test whether the dwarf phenotype affects the production of recombinant proteins, we expressed the genes for anti-hepatitis B virus antibodies (anti-HBs) in tobacco plants and found that the production of anti-HBs per unit fresh weight did not significantly differ between wild-type and AtIBH1SRDX plants. These data indicate that P35S:AtIBH1SRDX plants produced about fourfold more antibody per unit of cultivation volume, compared with wild type. Our results indicate that AtIBH1SRDX provides a useful tool for the modification of plant phenotype for cost-effective production of high-value products by stably transformed plants in plant factory conditions.

AB  - [Purpose] The present study investigated the physical and mental effects of plant factory work in individuals with cervical spinal cord injury and the use of a newly developed agricultural working environment. [Subjects] Six males with C5-C8 spinal cord injuries and 10 healthy volunteers participated. [Methods] Plant factory work involved three simulated repetitive tasks: sowing, transplantation, and harvesting. Surface electromyography was performed in the dominant upper arm, upper trapezius, anterior deltoid, and biceps brachii muscles. Subjects' moods were monitored using the Profile of Mood States. [Results] Five males with C6-C8 injuries performed the same tasks as healthy persons; a male with a C5 injury performed fewer repetitions of tasks because it took longer. Regarding muscle activity during transplantation and harvesting, subjects with spinal cord injury had higher values for the upper trapezius and anterior deltoid muscles compared with healthy persons. The Profile of Mood States vigor scores were significantly higher after tasks in subjects with spinal cord injury. [Conclusion] Individuals with cervical spinal cord injury completed the plant factory work, though it required increased time and muscle activity. For individuals with C5-C8 injuries, it is necessary to develop an appropriate environment and assistive devices to facilitate their work.

AB  - Photosynthetic lighting is one of the main costs of running controlled environment agriculture facilities. To optimize photosynthetic lighting, it is important to understand how plants use the provided light. When photosynthetic pigments absorb photons, the energy from those photons is used to drive the light reactions of photosynthesis, thermally dissipated, or re-emitted by chlorophyll as fluorescence. Chlorophyll fluorescence measurements can be used to determine the quantum yield of photosystem II (Phi(PSII)) and nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ), which is indicative of the amount of absorbed light energy that is dissipated as heat. Our objective was to develop and test a biofeedback system that allows for the control of photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) based on the physiological performance of the plants. To do so, we used a chlorophyll fluorometer to measure Phi(PSII), and used these data and PPFD to calculate the electron transport rate (ETR) through PSII. A datalogger then adjusted the duty cycle of the light-emitting diodes (LEDs) based on the ratio of the measured ETR to a predefined target ETR (ETRT). The biofeedback system was able to maintain ETRs of 70 or 100 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1) over 16-hour periods in experiments conducted with lettuce (Lactuca sativa). With an ETRT of 70 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1), Phi(PSII) was stable throughout the 16 hour and no appreciable changes in PPFD were needed. At an ETRT of 100 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1), Phi(PSII) gradually decreased from 0.612 to 0.582. To maintain ETR at 100 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1), PPFD had to be increased from 389 to 409 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1), resulting in a gradual decrease of Phi(PSII) and an increase in NPQ. The ability of the biofeedback system to achieve a range of different ETRs within a single day was tested using lettuce, sweetpotato (Ipomoea batatas), and pothos (Epipremnum aureum). As the ETRT was gradually increased, the PPFD required to achieve that ETR also increased, whereas Phi(PSII) decreased. Surprisingly, a subsequent decrease in ETRT, and in the PPFD required to achieve that ETR, resulted in only a small increase in Phi(PSII). This indicates that Phi(PSII) was reduced because of photoinhibition. Our results show that the biofeedback system is able to maintain a wide range of ETRs, while it also is capable of distinguishing between NPQ and photoinhibition as causes for decreases in Phi(PSII).

AB  - The high energy consumption of a plant factory is the biggest issue in its rapid expansion, especially for lighting electricity, which has been solved to a large extent by light-emitting diodes (LED). However, the remarkable potential for further energy savings remains to be further investigated. In this study, an optical system applied just below the LED was designed. The effects of the system on the growth and photosynthesis of butterhead lettuce (Lactuca sativa var. capitata) were examined, and the performance of the optical improvement in energy savings was evaluated by comparison with the traditional LED illumination mode. The irradiation patterns used were LED with zoom lenses (Z-LED) and conventional non-lenses LED (C-LED). The seedlings in both treatments were exposed to the same light environment over the entire growth period. The improvement saved over half of the light source electricity, while prominently lowering the temperature. Influenced by this, the rate of photosynthesis sharply decreased, causing reductions in plant yield and nitrate content, while having no negative effects on morphological parameters and photosynthetic pigment contents. Nevertheless, the much higher light use efficiency of Z-LEDs makes this system a better approach to illumination in a plant factory with artificial lighting.

AB  - The timing of measurement during plant growth is important because many genes are expressed periodically and orchestrate physiological events. Their periodicity is generated by environmental fluctuations as external factors and the circadian clock as the internal factor. The circadian clock orchestrates physiological events such as photosynthesis or flowering and it enables enhanced growth and herbivory resistance. These characteristics have possible applications for agriculture. In this study, we demonstrated the diurnal variation of the transcriptome in tomato (Solanum lycopersicurn) leaves through molecular timetable method in a sunlight-type plant factory. Molecular timetable methods have been developed to detect periodic genes and estimate individual internal body time from these expression profiles in mammals. We sampled tomato leaves every 2 h for 2 days and acquired time-course transcriptome data by RNA-Seq. Many genes were expressed periodically and these expressions were stable across the 1st and 2nd days of measurement. We selected 143 time-indicating genes whose expression indicated periodically, and estimated internal time in the plant from these expression profiles. The estimated internal time was generally the same as the external environment time; however, there was a difference of more than 1 h between the two for some sampling points. Furthermore, the stress-responsive genes also showed weakly periodic expression, implying that they were usually expressed periodically, regulated by light dark cycles as an external factor or the circadian clock as the internal factor, and could be particularly expressed when the plant experiences some specific stress under agricultural situations. This study suggests that circadian clock mediate the optimization for fluctuating environments in the field and it has possibilities to enhance resistibility to stress and floral induction by controlling circadian clock through light supplement and temperature control.

AB  - For the production of plants in controlled environments such as greenhouses and plant factories, crop modeling and simulations are effective tools for configuring the optimal growth environment. The objective of this study was to develop a coupled photosynthetic model of sweet basil (Ocimum basilicum L.) reflecting plant factory conditions. Light response curves were generated using photosynthetic models such as negative exponential, rectangular hyperbola, and non-rectangular hyperbola functions. The light saturation and compensation points determined by regression analysis of light curves using modified non-rectangular hyperbola function in sweet basil leaves were 545.3 and 26.5 A mu mol center dot m(-2)center dot s(-1), respectively. The non-rectangular hyperbola was the most accurate with complicated parameters, whereas the negative exponential was more accurate than the rectangular hyperbola and could more easily acquire the parameters of the light response curves of sweet basil compared to the non-rectangular hyperbola. The CO2 saturation and compensation points determined by regression analysis of the A-C-i curve were 728.8 and 85.1 A mu mol center dot mol(-1), respectively. A coupled biochemical model of photosynthesis was adopted to simultaneously predict the photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, transpiration, and temperature of sweet basil leaves. The photosynthetic parameters, maximum carboxylation rate, potential rate of electron transport, and rate of triose phosphate utilization determined by Sharkey's regression method were 102.6, 117.7, and 7.4 A mu mol center dot m(-2)center dot s(-1), respectively. Although the A-C-i regression curve of the negative exponential had higher accuracy than the biochemical model, the coupled biochemical model enable to physiologically explain the photosynthesis of sweet basil leaves.

AB  - There is a recent awareness of the importance of plants in our everyday lives. Light is a requirement for plants and serves two important roles. It provides energy for growth and provides information that elicits plant responses including, among others, plant shape, pigmentation, nutritional content and resistance to stress. Light is paradoxical to plants, it is a requirement however, in excess it is damaging. Plants sense and interpret light through many families of photoreceptors and through the energy state of the photosynthetic apparatus. Light emitting diodes (LEDs) are quickly replacing traditional light sources for human applications, and currently there is effort being put into tailoring these technology platforms for the plant community. Potential plant sensing pathways and the spectral effects on pigmentation and photochemistry in red lettuce are described.

AB  - The studies conducted on light emitting diode plant factories have mostly adopted hydroponics for convenient nutrient management and pest and disease prevention. In particular, in nutrient management, liquid electrolytes can be measured to determine the aqueous nutrient concentrations and absorption rates as well as electrical conductivity (EC) and pH variations. Precisely controlling the aqueous nutrient contents is crucial to large-scale healthy plant production. However, in most of the current conductivity measurements, electrodes are adopted for determining the nutrient additive concentrations. This approach can be problematic in some cases, such as low electrode sensitivity, which results in nutrient overdose, specifically in nonconductive additives, and hinders plant growth. Therefore, this paper proposes an optical method for measuring the aqueous nutrient contents. In this method, the high sensitivity of common-path heterodyne interferometry is incorporated into aqueous measurements to prevent errors caused by interfering impurities on the electrodes and improve measurement and analytical accuracy. The sensitivity of the sensor used in EC measurements can reach 2300 degrees/mS . cm(-1). The method has some merits, e.g., a simple optical setup, high stability etc., high measurement accuracy, high resolution, rapid measurement, and easy operation. In addition, its feasibility is demonstrated.

AB  - Effective extension plant lighting or supplementing of certain spectral wavelengths of light can enhance the growth quality of plants. This article proposes an effective cloud-based light-emitting diode (LED) management system that employs an intelligent LED lighting technique and a plant physiology database to automatically adjust the required light conditions suitable for plant growth, including the light formula, light quality, and light/dark photoperiod. The proposed system can efficiently reduce labor costs and increase the production and quality of plants. Meanwhile, it saves electric energy consumption using a programmable lighting control technique. The results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed system in a plant factory. Tissue analyses are also performed to assess the growth response of plants under different lighting modes. The proposed cloud-based lighting management system can be applied to greenhouses to achieve standardized plant production and automation in the future.

AB  - Recently, the so-called "plant factory with artificial lighting" (PFAL) approach has been developed to provide safe and steady food production. Although PFALs can produce high-yielding and high-quality plants, the high plant density in these systems accelerates leaf senescence in the bottom (or outer) leaves owing to shading by the upper (or inner) leaves and by neighboring plants. This decreases yield and increases labor costs for trimming. Thus, the establishment of cultivation methods to retard senescence of outer leaves is an important research goal to improve PFAL yield and profitability. In the present study, we developed an LED lighting apparatus that would optimize light conditions for PFAL cultivation of a leafy vegetable. Lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) was hydroponically grown under white, red, or blue LEDs, with light provided from above (downward), with or without supplemental upward lighting from underneath the plant. White LEDs proved more appropriate for lettuce growth than red or blue LEDs, and the supplemental lighting retarded the senescence of outer leaves and decreased waste (i.e., dead or low-quality senescent leaves), leading to an improvement of the marketable leaf fresh weight.

AB  - A complete control type plant factory has high efficiency in terms of cultivation area by constructing vertical multiple layered cultivation beds. However, it has a problem of irregular crop growth due to temperature deviation at upper and lower beds and increases in energy consumption by a prolonged cultivation period. In this work, air flow rate inside a facility was improved by a hybrid control of air flow devices like air conditioning and air circulation fan with an established wireless sensor network to minimize temperature deviations between upper and lower beds and to promote crop growth. The performance of proposed system was verified with an experimental environment or Case A wherein air conditioning device was operated without a control algorithm and Case B wherein air conditioning and circulation fans were alternatively operated based on the hybrid control algorithm. After planting leafy vegetables under each experimental condition, crops were cultivated for 21 days. As a result, Case B wherein AC (air conditioning) and ACF (air-circulation fan) were alternatively operated based on the hybrid control algorithm showed that fresh mass, number of leaves, and leaf length for the crops grown were increased by 40.6%, 41.1%, and 11.1%, respectively, compared to Case A.

AB  - In plant factories, measurements of plant conditions are necessary at an early stage of growth to predict harvest times of high value-added crops. Moreover, harvest qualities depend largely on environmental stresses that elicit plant hormone responses. However, the complexities of plant hormone networks have not been characterized under nonstress conditions. In the present study, we determined temporal expression profiles of all genes and then focused on plant hormone pathways using RNA-Seq analyses of gene expression in tomato leaves every 2 h for 48 h. In these experiments, temporally expressed genes were found in the hormone synthesis pathways for salicylic acid, abscisic acid, ethylene, and jasmonic acid. The timing of CAB expression 1 (TOC1) and abscisic acid insensitive 1 (ABA1) and open stomata 1 (OST1) control gating stomata. In this study, compare with tomato and Arabidopsis thaliana, expression patterns of TOC1 have similarity. In contrast, expression patterns of tomato ABI1 and OST1 had expression peak at different time. These findings suggest that the regulation of gating stomata does not depend predominantly on TOC1 and significantly reflects the extracellular environment. The present data provide new insights into relationships between temporally expressed plant hormone-related genes and clock genes under normal sunlight conditions.

AB  - It is predicted that the world population will reach 9 billion by 2050, of which 70% will live in urban centres. This change, alongside a changing climate, will strain Earth's resources, especially the food supply chain. One idea that has been proposed to address this issue is vertical farming - the urban farming of fruits, vegetables, and grains, inside a building in a city or urban centre, in which floors are designed to accommodate certain crops. While an interesting theoretical concept, no studies currently exist that quantify or qualify the validity of such an idea. The purpose of this paper, therefore, is to examine the feasibility and plausibility of the vertical farming concept from a socio technical, mixed methods, research perspective. This includes (1) examining how much energy is needed to power such a building and whether renewable energy can meet the onsite demands of the building by constructing a energy model, (2) quantifying the carbon footprint of vertically grown produce and subsequently comparing that to conventionally grown produce, and (3) conducting interviews to explore how relevant stakeholders perceive the concept of vertical farming in order to identify what are current barriers and opportunities exist towards possible uptake of the technology. The findings indicate that vertical farming is a tool that can be used to supply food to cities in a sustainable manner, but this depends on the location and design. Areas of future research are identified. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The use of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to support plant growth is a radical departure from use of gas-discharge lamps, which were developed in mid-19th and widely adopted by the industry during the 20th century. Initial investigation by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in the late 1980s on the use of LEDs to grow plant in space is resulting in an industry-wide transition from gas discharge to solid-state lighting systems. This global transformation is given urgency by national policies to reduce energy consumption and being facilitated by ready access to information on LEDs. The combination of research, government policy, and information technology has resulted in an exponential increase in research into the use and application of LED technology in horticulture. Commercial horticulture has identified the opportunities provided by LEDs to optimize light spectra to promote growth, regulate morphology, increase nutrient content, and reduce operating costs. LED-light technology is enabling the development of innovative lighting systems, and is being incorporated into large-scale plant factories for the production of edible, ornamental, and medicinal plants. An overview of prevalence of readily accessible information on LEDs and implications for future adoption in horticulture is discussed.

AB  - Plant factories have attracted increasing attention because they can produce fresh fruits and vegetables free from pesticides in all weather. However, the emission spectra from current light sources significantly mismatch the spectra absorbed by plants. We demonstrate a concept of using multiple broad-band as well as narrow-band solid-state lighting technologies to design plant-growth light sources. Take an organic light-emitting diode (OLED), for example; the resulting light source shows an 84% resemblance with the photosynthetic action spectrum as a twin-peak blue dye and a diffused mono-peak red dye are employed. This OLED can also show a greater than 90% resemblance as an additional deeper red emitter is added. For a typical LED, the resemblance can be improved to 91% if two additional blue and red LEDs are incorporated. The approach may facilitate either an ideal use of the energy applied for plant growth and/or the design of better light sources for growing different plants.

AB  - Air anions affect plant growth by stimulating various biological mechanisms. We investigated the effect of atmospheric anion concentrations on plant growth and mineral concentration in kale (Brassica oleracea var. acephala cv. TBC) plants cultivated in a plant factory. Kale seedlings grown under normal growth conditions for two weeks were transplanted to a nutrient film technique (NFT) system in a plant factory equipped with light-emitting diodes (LEDs) [red:white:blue (RWB) = 8:1:1 and red:green:blue (RGB) = 8:1:1, 181 +/- 4.0 A mu mol center dot m(-2)center dot s(-1), 12 h photoperiod]. Three concentrations of air anions (low, 2.9 x 10(5) ions center dot cm(-3); medium, 5.4 x 10(5) ions center dot cm(-3); and high, 7.8 x 10(5) ions center dot cm(-3)) were applied to the kale seedlings for four weeks using high voltage air anion generators. The medium and high levels of air anions increased shoot fresh weight to approximately 1.5-fold compared to the control after four weeks. Medium and high-level air anion treatments led to significantly higher leaf area than the control. The medium level of air anions improved the photosynthetic rate at four weeks of treatment although there was no significant difference between air anion treatments and the control. In addition, transpiration rate and stomatal conductance were significantly increased in the low and medium levels of air anion treatments, which likely supported biomass accumulation. Air anions also increased mineral uptake. The content of macroelements (P, K, Ca, Mg, and S) was at least 1.5-fold higher for plants exposed to RGB LEDs and 1.3-fold higher under RWB LEDs exposure. Microelements (Fe, Mn, and Zn) were increased at least 1.6- and 1.3-fold in kale shoots treated with air anions under RGB and RWB LEDs, respectively. In conclusion, air anions had a positive effect on kale growth and air anion generators could be used as a new technology for enhancing plant growth in plant factories and greenhouses.

AB  - This study was aimed at investigating the production of phytochemicals that determine fruit quality, and evaluating growth characteristics of mature strawberry plants during cultivation under three different wavelengths (blue, red and blue plus red) of LED light. Cultivation was conducted in two separate locations, namely, a growth chamber (GC) illuminated with LED lights as the sole light source and a plastic greenhouse (PG) which was given supplemental LED light in addition to ambient light. It was noted that leaves of plants cultivated in the GC under LED lights displayed elevated levels of chlorophyll compared with those cultivated in the PG. In contrast, plants cultivated in the PG with supplementary LED lights yielded much higher production of fruits than those cultivated in the GC. Moreover, fruits harvested in the PG were demonstrated to contain higher levels of organic acids than those harvested in the GC. When the effects of different LED lights were examined, a remarkably higher production of fruits was achieved in the PG when ambient light was supplemented with either blue LED light or combined blue and red LED light. Furthermore, it was also noted that greater accumulation of organic acids and phytochemicals such as phenolic compounds were observed in the fruits that had been cultivated in the PG when ambient light was supplemented with either red LED light or combined blue and red LED lights.

AB  - Wheat (Triticum aestivum L) is one of the Most important agricultural crops in both space such as Bioregenerative Life Support Systems (BLSS) and urban agriculture fields, and its cultivation is affected by several environmental factors. The objective of this study was to investigate the influences of different environmental conditions (BLSS, plant factory, green house and field) on the wheat growth, thousand kernel weight (TKW), harvest index (HI), biomass yield and quality during their life cycle. The results showed that plant height partially influenced by the interaction effects with environment, and this influence decreased gradually with the plant development. It was found that there was no significant difference between the BLSS and plant factory treatments on yields per square, but the yield of green house and field treatments were both lower. TKW and HI in BLSS and plant factory were larger than those in the green house and field. However, grain protein concentration can be inversely correlated with grain yield. Grain protein concentrations decreased under elevate CO2 condition and the magnitude of the reductions depended on the prevailing environmental condition. Conditional interaction effects with environment also influenced the components of straw during the mature stage. It indicated that CO2 enriched environment to some extent was better for inedible biomass degradation and had a significant effect on "source-sink flow" at grain filling stage, which was more beneficial to recycle substances in the processes of the environment regeneration.

AB  - Recently, plant factory is becoming widespread and drumming up in Japan. Agricultural residues have generated from there, are disposed of as waste after harvesting. We aimed to demonstrate the effectiveness of honewort leaves, stems and roots, and spinach roots as a pellet material, and investigated combustion tests in order to pelletize honewort leaves, stems and roots and spinach roots. Moreover, inorganic component in their pellets and combustion ash of their pellets was analyzed. Honewort leaves, stems and roots, and spinach roots could be pelletized in 11% wet. Next, although honewort pellets could not be combusted continuously, spinach pellets could be combusted the same level as wood pellets. Inorganic contents in their pellets combustion ash were significantly higher than those in wood pellets. These results indicated that spinach pellets and its combustion ash can be utilized as an energy source and fertilizer.

AB  - Global food production faces great challenges in the future. With a future world population of 9.6 billion by 2050, rising urbanization, decreasing arable land, and weather extremes due to climate change, global agriculture is under pressure. While today over 50 % of the world population live in cities, by 2030, the number will rise to 70 %. In addition, global emissions have to be kept in mind. Currently, agriculture accounts for around 20-30 % of global greenhouse gas emissions. Shifting food production to locations with high demands reduces emissions and mitigates climate change. Urban horticulture increases global food production by exploiting new locations for cultivation. However, higher land prices and urban pollution constrain urban horticulture. In this paper, we review different urban cultivation systems throughout the world. Our main findings from ecological, economical, and social aspects are: (1) Urban horticulture activities are increasing globally with at least 100 million people involved worldwide. With potential yields of up to 50 kg per m(2) per year and more, vegetable production is the most significant component of urban food production which contributes to global food security. (2) Organoponic and other low-input systems will continue to play an important role for a sustainable and secure food production in the future. (3) Despite the resource efficiency of indoor farming systems, they are still very expensive. (4) Integrating urban horticulture into educational and social programs improves nutrition and food security. Overlaying these, new technologies in horticultural research need to be adopted for urban horticulture to increase future efficiency and productivity. To enhance sustainability, urban horticulture has to be integrated into the urban planning process and supported through policies. However, future food production should not be "local at any price," but rather committed to increase sustainability.

AB  - We investigated the effects of various ratios of red to far-red light-emitting diodes (LEDs) on growth characteristics, physiological response, and cell division of red leaf lettuce. Sixteen-day-old lettuce seedlings were transferred into growth chambers and cultivated under various ratios of red (R) and far-red (FR) LEDs (R/FR = 0.7, 1.2, 4.1, and 8.6), only red LEDs (RED), or fluorescent lamps (control) for 22 days. Growth characteristics were measured at 11 and 22 days of treatment. In addition, cell division rate, epidermal cell density, chlorophyll fluorescence, and photosynthesis of leaves were analyzed. Fresh and dry weights and leaf area in all R/FR treatments were higher than those in the control at 22 days of treatment. The R/FR 1.2 had the highest values among R/FR treatments. The number of leaves appeared to increase as R/FR ratio increased. The specific leaf weights in the R/FR ratio of 0.7, 1.2, and 8.6 were similar to the control at 22 days of treatment. The SPAD values in all R/FR treatments were lower than that in the control. All R/FR treatments led to a longer leaf shape than the control. The percentage of cells in the G2M phase, indicating the cell division rate, increased in the R/FR treatments after 4 days of treatment, which supported the growth improvement in the R/FR treatments. The Fv/Fm and the photosynthetic rate in all treatments decreased due to the absence of blue light. The results of this study suggest that the supplementation with far-red LEDs should be considered when designing artificial lighting systems for closed-type plant factories since far-red light affects the vegetative growth of leafy vegetables such as lettuce.

AB  - To maximize fruit yield of tomatoes cultivated in a controlled, closed system such as a greenhouse or a plant factory at a limited cost, it is important to raise the translocation rate of fixed carbon to fruits by tuning the cultivation conditions. Elevation of atmospheric CO2 concentration is a good candidate; however, it is technically difficult to evaluate the effect on fruit growth by comparing different individuals in different CO2 conditions because of large inter-individual variations. In this study, we employed a positron-emitting tracer imaging system (PETIS), which is a live-imaging technology for plant studies, and a short-lived radioisotope C-11 to quantitatively analyze immediate responses of carbon fixation and translocation in tomatoes in elevated CO2 conditions. We also developed a closed cultivation system to feed a test plant with CO2 at concentrations of 400, 1,500 and 3,000 ppm and a pulse of (CO2)-C-11. As a result, we obtained serial images of C-11 fixation by leaves and subsequent translocation into fruits. Carbon fixation was enhanced steadily by increasing the CO2 concentration, but the amount translocated into fruits saturated at 1,500 ppm on average. The translocation rate had larger inter-individual variation and showed less consistent responses to external CO2 conditions compared with carbon fixation. Our experimental system was demonstrated to be a valuable tool for the optimization of closed cultivation systems because it can trace the responses of carbon translocation in each individual, which are otherwise usually masked by inter-individual variation.

AB  - In a commercialized, fully artificial plant factory, artificial luminaire is arranged in a unified way using a general illumination theory, an actual measurement, or an empirical methodology. However, with these methods, lightings are implemented without considering specific optical characteristics of lighting or material characteristics of each component that constructs a cultivation system, resulting in an amount of light that becomes irregular. The amount of lighting is closely related with the growth and quality of crops, and the deviation between points where cultivated crops are located causes quality difference in the produced crops, thus impairing the economic feasibility of a plant factory. In this regard, a simulation to figure out an optimum lighting layout was performed. Arrangements based on the spectrum distribution of light source and reflector materials were implemented to ascertain the distance between lighting and height of lighting and gather information in the pre-treatment process to improve the uniformity of light in the plant cultivation system. Improvement of around 15% in light uniformity is achieved compared with the existing system after the simulation is carried out. This result would reduce the deviation in crop growth to make uniform quality crop production possible.

AB  - Technology design and effectiveness studies available in the scientific literature demonstrate future mitigation potentials of nitrogen-related greenhouse gases. Here we investigate 'innovations' influencing such emissions. These innovations mainly address agriculture: reduced meat diets, urban gardening, genetically modified crops, and precision farming, but also more distant options such as vertical farming and cultured meat production, that is, indoor agriculture. While the latter approaches, which allow full management of effluents, seem very promising in terms of emission control, the cost estimates available would rule out any practical relevance. Technologies that currently seem more realistic offer much smaller mitigation potential. Information on energy need, greenhouse gas emissions, and land requirements feed into a semi-quantitative assessment, which delivers information in a format useful for existing European policy tools.

AB  - Japan is facing the twin challenges of energy conservation and climate change in the post-Fukushima era. Industrial and power plant-sourced waste heat is a significant potential resource for nearby sinks. However, because industrial facilities are not usually optimally located for waste heat utilization, most of the potential heat is emitted to the surrounding environment. To achieve the future targets of the efficient energy provision network system in the coastal regions of Fukushima that experienced tsunami devastation, this study developed a simulation process model integrating spatial analysis, technology systems, and land use controls to maximize the utilization of waste heat from coal-fired thermal power plants to nearby plant factories. Shinchi-town in Fukushima Prefecture was selected as a case study, in which an energy symbiosis network was being constructed. Our findings indicated that the waste heat system provided more environmental benefits than the individual boiler system. With waste heat utilization, fuel oil consumption is reduced by 16.05 Tliyear, while total CO2 emissions are reduced by 1204 ton/year. In addition, as economic feasibility depends on the distance between the power plant and the factory, cost-effective areas with regards to heat supply were identified based on cost-benefit analysis and geographic information system techniques. Finally, policy implications to support the construction of an energy symbiosis network are proposed and discussed. Such a resolution with energy symbiosis and waste heat utilization would shed light on the Japanese energy dilemma. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this study, the effects of light-emitting diode (LED) panels with different illumination schedules and mounted above butterhead lettuce (Lactuca sativ a var. capitata) seedlings on lettuce growth and photosynthesis were examined, and the performance of the vertical and horizontal movable system on energy savings was evaluated. The illumination schedules used were fixed LED [F-LED (four LED panels illuminated the area below)] and movable LED [M-LED (two LED panels moved left and right once per day to illuminate the same area as F-LED)] at distances of 10 and 30 cm above the seedlings. The plant yields were uniform in all LED treatments. The highest light utilization efficiencies and lowest electricity consumption were found for the treatments with irradiation from a shorter distance above the seedlings. The true leaf numbers and ascorbic acid concentrations were the highest in the M-LED and F-LED treatments at a distance above the seedlings of 10 cm, while the leaf lengths and sucrose concentrations in these groups were significantly lower than those in the 30-cm treatment. These results indicate that illumination with M-LED can halve the initial light source input while maintaining yield and that sustained illumination from a shorter distance above the seedlings is the main factor in electricity savings.

AB  - Agriculture in Japan is approaching a crisis for two reasons: a declining self-sufficiency rate and a decreasing number of agriculture workers. To solve these problems, plant factories have been attracting attention recently. Plant factories are facilities that aid the steady production of high-quality vegetables year round by artificially controlling the cultivation environment, allowing growers to drastically decrease production time. Despite the many advantages of plant factories, a main impediment is the reduction of initial and running costs. This paper utilizes leaf lettuce (Early impulse), which is a typical item cultivated in plant factories, as a target to improve productive efficiency of plant factories due to its relatively high price. Various pulsed electric fields (PEFs) were applied to roots of the lettuce to increase lettuce growth rate. The experimental results show PEF intensity from 0.2 to 1.0 kV/cm is positive for growth stimulation. Conversely, those over 1.0 kV/cm resulted in growth inhibition. Furthermore, roots of the samples which exhibited increased leaf weight grew more robustly than those of decreased leaf weight. In addition, analysis results showed that there was no significant difference when liquid fertilizer was applied prior to or after application of PEF. The results suggest that PEF does not affect the composition change of liquid fertilizer but directly influences the growth of leaf lettuce.

AB  - This study was conducted to determine the effect of air anions on lettuce growth in a plant factory. Red leaf lettuce (Lactuca sativa L. cv. 'Jeokchima') seedlings grown under normal growth conditions (20A degrees C, fluorescent lamp, 150 +/- 3 mu mol center dot m(-2)center dot s(-1) PPFD, 12-h photoperiod) for 18 days were transplanted to hydroponic systems in a plant factory equipped with LEDs (red:blue = 78:22, 184 +/- 2 mu mol center dot m(-2)center dot s(-1) PPFD, 12-h photoperiod). Three levels of air anions (low, 10 x 10(4) ion center dot cm(-3); medium, 19 x 104 ion center dot cm(-3); and high, 70 x 10(4) ion center dot cm(-3)) were applied to lettuce plants for 4 weeks. Lettuce plants exposed to air anions showed vigorous growth after 2 and 4 weeks of treatment. Both the medium and high levels of air anions improved growth characteristics such as leaf area and fresh weight of shoots, but there were no significant differences in the number of leaves and SPAD values were observed between the treatments. The medium level of air anions resulted in a 64% increase in shoot fresh weight compared to the control at 4 weeks after treatment. The photosynthetic rate of lettuce grown in the medium level of air anions after 3 weeks of treatment was 30% higher than that of the control. In addition, energy use efficiency in air anion treatments was higher than that in the control. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that the application of air anions in a plant factory imparts a positive effect on lettuce growth with low production cost.

AB  - Photovoltaic (PV) generation systems have been shown to have a promising role for use in high electric-load buildings, such as the closed plant factory which is dependent upon artificial lighting. The power generated by the PV systems can be either directly supplied to the buildings or fed back into the electrical grid to reduce the high economic costs and environmental impact associated with the traditional energy sources such as nuclear power and fossil fuels. However, PV systems usually suffer from low energy-conversion efficiency, and it is therefore necessary to improve their performance by tackling the energy loss issues. The maximum power point tracking (MPPT) control technique is essential to the PV-assisted generation systems in order to achieve the maximum power output in real time. In this study, we integrate the previously proposed direct-prediction MPP method with a perturbation and observation (P&O) method to develop a new hybrid MPPT method. The proposed MPPT method is further utilized in the PV inverters in a PV system installed on the roof of a closed plant factory at National Taiwan University. The tested PV system is constructed as a two-stage grid-connected photovoltaic power conditioning (PVPC) system with a boost-buck full bridge design configuration. A control scheme based on the hybrid MPPT method is also developed and implemented in the PV inverters of the PVPC system to achieve tracking of the maximum power output of the PV system in real time. Based on experimental results obtained in an outdoor environment over a period of one year, the hybrid MPPT method not only decreases energy loss but also increases power utilization. These results demonstrate the applicability of the PV system to a closed plant factory for saving energy consumption and reducing CO2 emissions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Sustainable plant factory systems are able to provide steady and high-quality plants to markets while using less labor, water, nutrition, and pesticides. A plant factory is a controlled environment for plant production systems with artificial light, temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide, water supply, and cultivation solution. This paper focuses on the entry and competition of a plant factory supply chain in vegetable markets, using a Nash-Cournot model to simulate this competition. The Lagrangian multiplier method is used to derive KKT optimality conditions for the model. Combining the optimality conditions yields a linear complementarity problem (LCP), which is solved by GAMS and PATH. A case study of the plant factory supply chain in nine Taiwanese vegetable markets is presented. The research simulates the impact of the location of plant factories, number of firms, and different market demands. The results show that total production and profits of the plant factory supply chain increase as transportation costs decrease. In addition, the producer surplus, consumer surplus, and total surplus of the plant factory supply chain in Taiwanese markets improve when factories are located close to the markets. A sensitivity analysis is conducted which shows the impact of market share and production cost on the plant factory supply chain. While the case study focuses on the Taiwanese agricultural commodity production, the methodology and analysis procedures have generalizability to similar plant production industry problems in other contexts.

AB  - This paper proposed environmental parameters are collected by use of outdoor ZigBee based weather stations as a prerequisite for the optimisation of plant growth. In most cases, all the sensors required are integrated into a weather station, due to which merely a single monitoring node is employed following data aggregation. An energy efficient center data aggregation algorithm, where an ant colony algorithm is applied to the construction of a level gradient field, is presented as an effective way to extend the life cycles of sensor nodes. A weather station and a ZigBee module both are portable and easy to install battery operated devices. Furthermore, a remote web-based human machine interface (HMI) is developed by InduSof on a server, and has an access to a database. This proposed algorithm is confirmed by computer simulations as an effective approach to remarkably extend the life cycles of sensor nodes. This work can be applied not merely to traditional outdoor large scale farming, but also to small scale indoor plantation, e.g. in a green house, a plant factory, etc., and applied to the field of conservation ecology.

AB  - BACKGROUNDThe production of high-quality crops based on phytochemicals is a strategy for accelerating the practical use of plant factories. Previous studies have demonstrated that ultraviolet (UV) light is effective in improving phytochemical production. This study aimed to determine the effect of various UV wavelengths on growth and phenolic compound accumulation in lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) grown in a closed-type plant production system.
   RESULTSSeven days, 1 day and 0.25 day were determined as the upper limit of the irradiation periods for UV-A, -B, and -C, respectively, in the lettuce based on physiological disorders and the fluorescence parameter F-v/F-m. Continuous UV-A treatment significantly induced the accumulation of phenolic compounds and antioxidants until 4 days of treatment without growth inhibition, consistent with an increase in phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) gene expression and PAL activity. Repeated or gradual UV-B exposure yielded approximately 1.4-3.6 times more total phenolics and antioxidants, respectively, than the controls did 2 days after the treatments, although both treatments inhibited lettuce growth. Repeated UV-C exposure increased phenolics but severely inhibited the growth of lettuce plants.
   CONCLUSIONOur data suggest that UV irradiation can improve the accumulation of phenolic compounds with antioxidant properties in lettuce cultivated in plant factories. (c) 2013 Society of Chemical Industry

AB  - World population will be approximately 9 billion by the year 2050. Additional area required to feed this population using available technologies equals to the size of Brazil. Because of the decrease in agricultural lands that will nourish people, the crop losses caused by emerging new pests and diseases, climate change and environmental pollution, the development of alternative agricultural systems in order for the production needed to be made to feed people has become compulsory. Therefore, 'Vertical Farming Systems', which is one of the agricultural systems where the yield (harvest) to be received from the unit area is high, is progressing on the way to becoming an agricultural system that will rapidly develop in the future. However, for sustainable production and energy in this system, engineering, architecture, technology and experiences are needed to be used all together. Thus, in this agricultural system with advanced technology, production made in an area of 4000-30 000 m(2) is being achieved in an area of 1000 m(2); the risk of crop loss dependent on conditions like aridity, floods, pests and disease, etc. is eliminated. By virtue of the utilisation of renewable energy resources (solar, wind, etc.), environmental pollution and fossil fuel consumption decreases. Due to multiplex buildings and systems, it is enabled to carry out agriculture in the city centre and healthy products are provided in the sense of food safety.

AB  - To maintain the production timing, productivity, and product quality of plant factories, it is necessary to keep the growth environment uniform. A vertical multistage type of plant factory involves different levels of growing trays, which results in the problem of difference in temperature among vertically different locations. To address it, it is necessary to install air flow devices such as air flow fan and cooling/heating device at the proper locations in order to facilitate air circulation in the facility as well as develop a controlling technology for efficient operation. Accordingly, this study compares the temperature and air distribution within the space of a vertical multistage closed-type plant factory by controlling cooling/heating devices and air flow fans harmoniously by means of the specially designed testbed. The experiment results indicate that in the hybrid control of cooling and heating devices and air flow fans, the difference in temperature decreased by as much as 78.9% compared to that when only cooling and heating devices were operated; the air distribution was improved by as much as 63.4%.

CP  - 4th International Workshop on Computer Image Analysis in Agriculture, held at CIGR-AgEng
AB  - In plant science, the fundamental information for research and related applications is derived from the measurement of plant features. It is especially useful for applications in plant growth modelling and climate control in greenhouses or plant factories. Standard, direct measurement methods are generally simple and reliable, but they are time consuming and laborious. In contrast, vision-based methods are non-destructive and an efficient way to describe external plant features and plant growth. In this study, a stereo-vision system, using two off-the-shelf cameras with parallel optical axes, integrated a self-developed image processing algorithm to monitor the growth of Boston lettuce in a plant factory. The system was mounted on a sliding rail to extend the field of vision of planting beds. Images were continuously recorded to determine the plants' features and construct panoramic images. The image processing algorithms, that calculated geometric features such as the projected leaf area, plant height, volume and diameters were developed and incorporated into the automated measurement system. Subsequently, plant growth curves were determined from calculations of the plant features data. This automated vision-based system showed promising results when put into practice. (C) 2013 IAgrE.

AB  - Effect of light provided by various light intensities combined with different photoperiods on the growth and morphogenesis of lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) 'Hongyeom Jeockchukmyeon' in a closed-type plant factory system were evaluated in this study. Four light intensity treatments, i.e., 200, 230, 260, and 290 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1) PPFD, provided from light-emitting diodes (LEDs), with a combination of three different photoperiods 18/6 (1 cycle), 9/3 (2 cycles) or 6/2 (3 cycles) (light/dark) were used. The combination of 290-9/3 (light intensity-photoperiod) showed the highest plant height and fresh shoot weight, while plants grown at 290-18/6 exhibited the greatest root fresh weight, leaf dry weight, and longest root length. The greatest leaf width, maximum number of leaves, and greatest root dry weight were observed in the treatment combination of 290-6/2. Anthocyanin content was found to be highest in the 290-6/2 and lowest in the 200-6/2 treatment, whereas chlorophyll fluorescence was observed to be highest in the 260-6/2 and the lowest in the 290-9/3 treatment. Our data showed that providing a high light intensity of 290 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1) PPFD with a shorter photoperiod of 6/2 (light/dark) resulted in good plant growth and development of lettuce, whereas growth at light intensities of 230 or 260 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1) PPFD with longer photoperiods of 18/6 and 9/3 (light/dark) resulted in good growth as well as higher photosynthetic capacity.

AB  - Extensive research has recently been conducted on plant factory with artificial light, which is one type of closed plant production system (CPPS) consisting of a thermally insulated and airtight structure, a multi-tier system with lighting devices, air conditioners and fans, a CO2 supply unit, a nutrient solution supply unit, and an environment control unit. One of the research outcomes is the concept of resource use efficiency (RUE) of CPPS.
   This paper reviews the characteristics of the CPPS compared with those of the greenhouse, mainly from the viewpoint of RUE, which is defined as the ratio of the amount of the resource fixed or held in plants to the amount of the resource supplied to the CPPS.
   It is shown that the use efficiencies of water, CO2 and light energy are considerably higher in the CPPS than those in the greenhouse. On the other hand, there is much more room for improving the light and electric energy use efficiencies of CPPS. Challenging issues for CPPS and RUE are also discussed.

AB  - This study was conducted to improve the yield and quality of red chicory (Cichorium intybus L.) and garland chrysanthemum (Chrysanthemum coronarium L.) grown in a plant factory where fluorescent lamps were used as an artificial light source. Seeds of a chicory 'Juck' and garland chrysanthemum 'Joongyupssuckgot' were sown in a peat-lite germination mix. Twenty-day old seedlings with roots being washed off were anchored on a styrofoam board and were grown in hydroponics for 30 days. Plants were exposed to one of the three different air temperature regimes (20, 25, and 30A degrees C during the day combined with 18A degrees C during the night) which were being monitored with a sensor at 30 cm above the plant canopy. In all treatments, light intensity was maintained at 200 +/- 20 mu mol center dot m(-2)center dot s(-1), day length was 12 hours, and relative humidity was 50-80%. Electrical conductivity (EC) and pH of the nutrient solution were 2.0 +/- 0.2 dS center dot m(-1) and 6.5-7.0, respectively, in all treatments. Increase in fresh weight was observed in chicory, but not in garland chrysanthemum, in both 25 and 30A degrees C as compared to 20A degrees C. Photosynthetic capacity and ascorbic acid content of chicory leaves were higher at 25A degrees C than in other temperatures. In garland chrysanthemum, photosynthetic capacity was the greatest in both 20 and 25A degrees C, while ascorbic acid content was the greatest in 25A degrees C. Also plants grown at 25A degrees C had the greatest contents of total phenol and flavonoid in both chicory and garland chrysanthemum. Hence, the optimum temperature appears to be 25A degrees C for growing both chicory and garland chrysanthemum in the plant factory with fluorescent light as the sole souse of light.

AB  - This study aimed to establish a practical method to reduce tipburn symptoms on leaf lettuce cultivars in a closed plant factory system, focusing on air temperature conversion at specific plant growth stages and artificial air flow application strategies using pre-screened tipburn-sensitive cultivars. Inter-conversion effect of day temperature among 18, 22, and 25A degrees C, 12 days after transplanting on tipburn occurrences, were compared with stable day temperature condition. Horizontal air flow rates were controlled at 0.28 (Low), 0.55 (Medium), and 1.04 m center dot s(-1) (High). Tipburn occurrences were highly variable depending on the lettuce cultivars tested. Following the initial screening of 28 leaf lettuce cultivars under 3 different light intensity conditions (ranging from 150 to 250 mol center dot m(-2)center dot s(-1)), two cultivars exhibiting relatively higher percentages of tipburn were selected for the following air temperature and air flow treatments. None of the temperature treatments effectively reduced tipburn symptom, while adjusting the temperature to a lower day temperatures at 12 days after transplanting only had a minor effect on lettuce growth and tipburn occurrence. In contrast, stable horizontal 24-hour air flow rates above 0.28 m center dot s(-1) effectively reduced tipburn symptom, with no significant differences being found among the tested air flow rates, while above 65% of tipburned plants were found in the control plot of 0.08 m center dot s(-1) flow rate. When stable air flow was applied, compared to the control, there was an increase in the absolute calcium content and a decrease in the calcium content difference between the inner and outer lettuce leaves. This calcium balance change may have occurred due to the enhanced transpiration in the inner parts of plants. This study showed that stable horizontal air flow application along cultivation beds is more effective than air temperature control in decreasing tipburn symptoms in a closed plant factory system.

AB  - Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) of short wavelength ranges are being developed as light sources in closed-type plant production systems. Among the various wavelengths, red and blue lights are known to be effective for enhancing plant photosynthesis. In this study, we determined the effects of blue and red LED ratios on leaf shape, plant growth, and the accumulation of antioxidant phenolic compounds of a red leaf lettuce (Lactuca sativa L. 'Sunmang') and a green leaf lettuce (Lactuca sativa L. 'Grand Rapid TBR'). Lettuce seedlings grown under normal growth conditions (20 degrees C, fluorescent lamp + high-pressure sodium lamp 177 +/- 5 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1), 12-hour photoperiod) for 18 days were transferred into growth chambers that were set at 20 degrees C and equipped with various combinations of blue (456 nm) and red (655 nm) LEDs [blue:red = 0:100 (0 B), 13:87 (13 B), 26:74 (26 B), 35:65 (35 B), 47:53 (47 B) or 59:41 (59 B)] under the same light intensity and photoperiod (171 +/- 7 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1), 12-hour photoperiod). Leaf width, leaf length, leaf area, fresh and dry weights of shoots and roots, chlorophyll content (SPAD value), total phenolic concentration, total flavonoid concentration, and antioxidant capacity were measured at 2 and 4 weeks after the onset of LED treatment. The leaf shape indices (leaf length/leaf width) of the two lettuce cultivars subjected to blue LEDs treatment were similar to the control, regardless of the blue-to-red ratio during the entire growth stage. However, 0 B (100% red LED) induced a significantly higher leaf shape index, which represents elongated leaf shape, compared with the other treatments. Increasing blue LED levels negatively affected lettuce growth. Most growth characteristics (such as the fresh and dry weights of shoots and leaf area) were highest under 0 B for both cultivars compared with all other LED treatments. For red and green leaf lettuce cultivar plants, shoot fresh weight under 0 B was 4.3 and 4.1 times higher compared with that under 59 B after 4 weeks of LED treatment, respectively. In contrast, the accumulation of chlorophyll, phenolics (including flavonoids), and antioxidants in both red and green leaf lettuce showed an opposite trend compared with that observed for growth. The SPAD value (chlorophyll content), total phenolic concentration, total flavonoid concentration, and antioxidant capacity of lettuces grown under high ratios of blue LED (such as 59 B, 47 B, and 35 B) were significantly higher compared with 0 B or control conditions. Thus, this study indicates that the ratio of blue to red LEDs is important for the morphology, growth, and phenolic compounds with antioxidant properties in the two lettuce cultivars tested.

AB  - Environmental concerns, including issues of ecological justice, attention to sustainability, and focus on issues of food security have gathered increased momentum in social work. This article will trace the background of sustainable urban agriculture as a partial solution to the issue of global food insecurity and its impact on marginalised urban populations. It will review the development of a sustainable agricultural initiative called vertical farming and suggest that it holds promise for communities struggling with chronic food security problems. It will outline some tentative steps social work may consider in order to become more fully involved in support of vertical farming initiatives.

AB  - Sesamin is a major lignan constituent of sesame seeds and beneficial to human health. We previously reported that sesamin is contained in leaves as well as seeds of sesame and proposed that sesame leaves could be a new sesamin source. Growth and constituents of plants are affected by light wavelength. In this study, growth and leaf sesamin content of sesame variety 'Gomazou' were investigated in plants grown under continuous white fluorescent and monochromatic red or blue light emitting diode (LED) light. Under red LED light, plants developed pale-green, epinastic leaves. Compared with white fluorescent light, red LED light promoted stem elongation 1-3 weeks after sowing but retarded it 3-5 weeks after sowing. Under blue LED light, plants exhibited interveinal necrosis in the leaf blades and excessive stem elongation occurred irrespective of plant age. Leaf yields were lower in plants grown under red and blue LED lights relative to those under white fluorescent light. Blue LED light increased leaf sesamin content by 2.0 and 4.5 times compared with white fluorescent and red LED lights, respectively. From these results, we concluded that blue (LED) light may be effective at producing sesamin-rich leaves if the unfavorable morphological changes and reduction in growth can be prevented.

AB  - The ability to monitor and control plant nutrient ions in fertigation solutions, on an ion-specific basis, is critical to the future of controlled environment agriculture crop production, be it in traditional terrestrial settings (e. g., greenhouse crop production) or as a component of bioregenerative life support systems for long duration space exploration. Several technologies are currently available that can provide the required measurement of ion-specific activities in solution. The greenhouse sector has invested in research examining the potential of a number of these technologies to meet the industry's demanding requirements, and although no ideal solution yet exists for on-line measurement, growers do utilize technologies such as high-performance liquid chromatography to provide off-line measurements. An analogous situation exists on the International Space Station where, technological solutions are sought, but currently on-orbit water quality monitoring is considerably restricted. This paper examines the specific advantages that on-line ion-selective sensors could provide to plant production systems both terrestrially and when utilized in space-based biological life support systems and how similar technologies could be applied to nominal on-orbit water quality monitoring. A historical development and technical review of the various ion-selective monitoring technologies is provided.

AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the growth characteristics of sowthistle (Ixeris dentata Nakai) under different levels of light intensity (photosynthetic photon flux, PPF), electrical conductivity (EC) of nutrient solution, and planting density for efficient production in a closed-type plant factory system. Growth and yield of the plants were analyzed at EC 1.5 and 2.0 dS center dot m(-1) with PPF 100 and 200 mu mol center dot m(-2)center dot s(-1). Further, growth and yield were measured under four different planting densities: a 15-cm between-row distance with within-row distances of 10, 15, 20, and 25 cm. Shoot dry weight and leaf photosynthetic rate all increased with increasing EC and light intensity. Shoot fresh and dry weights, chlorophyll content, and leaf photosynthetic rate were maximal at EC 2.0 dS center dot m(-1) with PPF 200 mu mol center dot m(-2)center dot s(-1). For all planting densities, number of leaves and leaf width were not significantly different. Shoot fresh and dry weights per plant were not significantly different, however, shoot fresh and dry weights per area decreased with increasing plating densities. A linear relationship was observed between the number of leaves and days after transplantation. Based on the results, we suggest a nutrient solution of EC 2.0 dS center dot m(-1), PPF 200 mu mol center dot m(-2) center dot s(-1), and planting density of 15x10 cm for maximal growth and yield of sowthistle in a closed-type plant factory.

AB  - Naturally occurring high levels of ethylene can be a problem in spaceflight and controlled environment agriculture (CEA) leading to sterility and irregular plant growth. There are engineering and safety advantages of growing plants under hypobaria (low pressure) for space habitation. The goals of this research were to successfully grow lettuce (Lactuca sativa cv. Buttercrunch) in a long-term study from seed to harvest under hypobaric conditions, and to investigate how endogenously produced ethylene affects gas exchange and plant growth from seed germination to harvest under hypobaric and ambient total pressure conditions. Lettuce was grown under two levels of total gas pressure [hypobaric or ambient (25 or 101 kPa)] in a long-term, 32-day study. Significant levels of endogenous ethylene occurred by day-15 causing reductions in photosynthesis, dark-period respiration, and a subsequent decrease in plant growth. Hypobaria did not mitigate the adverse ethylene effects on plant growth. Seed germination was not adversely affected by hypobaria, but was reduced by hypoxia (6 kPa pO(2)). Under hypoxia, seed germination was higher under hypobaria than ambient total pressure. This research shows that lettuce can be grown from seed to harvest under hypobaria (congruent to 25% of normal earth ambient total pressure). (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - Plants can synthesize some antioxidants, including L-ascorbic acid (AsA) and polyphenol, in response to environmental stresses. Antioxidants detoxify reactive oxygen species in plants and also aid in human health. In this study, we demonstrate that a novel hydroponic treatment can increase leafy vegetable nutritional quality without retarding growth. Leaf lettuce (Lactuca sativa) was grown hydroponically and subjected to rhizosphere drought stress by lowering the water level in the solution tub before harvesting. Appropriate drought stress using this method could increase AsA, polyphenol, and sugar content by 24%, 50%, and 17%, respectively, and decrease nitrate nitrogen content by 18% without reducing yield. Similar effects of drought stress on AsA content were observed in four other plant species. This hydroponic method has a universal potential to increase leafy vegetable quality without reducing yield in controlled environments such as plant factories.

AB  - Lettuce tipburn is an irreversible physiological disorder caused by calcium deficiency that decreases the crop value. Breeding a tipburn-resistant cultivar is the only causal therapy in many cases. In this study, we investigated an efficient method to evaluate lettuce resistance to tipburn in vitro. Seedlings of 19 lettuce cultivars representing three head types were cultured on agar medium containing EGTA, which chelates Ca2+. The percentage of tipburned leaves decreased proportionally with EGTA concentration. Susceptible cultivars were distinguished at 0.01 mM EGTA, whereas resistant cultivars were classified at 1.0 mM EGTA. Based on mean values of tipburn measurements, tipburn susceptibility was highest for 'Leaf Lettuce', followed by 'Butterhead Lettuce', and then 'Crisphead Lettuce'. Two cultivars were selected for further tests using hydroponic and pot culture. The rank order of susceptibility to tipburn in these experiments was consistent with that of the in vitro assay. The in vitro evaluation of lettuce susceptibility to calcium deficiency is useful for initial screening of lettuce cultivars against tipburn incidence. Resistant cultivars identified in this study are practical candidates for cultivation in controlled environments, such as a plant factory, while sensitive cultivars are also useful as indicator plants to monitor environmental conditions.

AB  - Over the next 50 years, rapid climate change issues will play a major role in agriculture. It is estimated for every 1A degrees of increase in atmospheric temperature, 10 % of the land where we now grow food crops will be lost. The ability of governments to provide essential services for its citizens, and in particular to maintain systems that provide a reliable and safe food and water supply becomes more and more problematic. In less developed countries, other problems also exist that will become magnified because of global warming. For example, diseases transmitted by fecal contamination, such as cholera, typhoid fever and a plethora of parasitic infections, are commonplace where human excrement is used as fertilizer (an estimated 50 % of all farming on the planet). These infections are in large part responsible for widespread poverty and illiteracy. Geo-helminths, alone, cripple enormous numbers of children and adults alike. Heavy infections with ascaris, hookworm and whipworm can permanently reduce a child's capacity for learning, and the diarrheal diseases they cause routinely keep them out of school. Illiteracy, malnutrition, and poverty are the result. Today, even in more developed countries where many of these kinds of infectious diseases have been either eradicated or are under control, food safety and security issues dominate the headlines. Over the last 5 years, in the United States alone, food recalls due to bacterial infectious diseases have resulted in billions of dollars of lost income. In traditional farming, a plethora of plant pathogens (e.g., rice blast, wheat rust) and insect pests (e.g., locusts) account for staggering losses of crops worldwide, further pushing the yields of most grain and vegetable crops towards lower and lower limits. Soil erosion due to floods and droughts completes the picture of climate change issues that have already significantly reduced where we can grow our food. The majority of environmental experts agree that farming as we know it will become marginalized over the next 50 years, as climate changes accelerate even more due to deforestation. This is because forests are being sacrificed for farmland. The consequence of this activity is that the carbon cycle is out of balance and will only get worse if nothing is done on a global scale. Controlled environment agriculture is one answer to reversing this situation. Greenhouse technologies are well-established and guarantee a safer, more reliable food supply that can be produced year round, and they can be located close to urban centers. By "stacking" these buildings on top of each other in an integrated well-engineered fashion, we can greatly reduce our agricultural footprint, and the vertical farm concept can then be applied to every urban center, regardless of location.

AB  - Population growth increases the demand for food and thus leads to expansion of cultivated land and intensification of agricultural production. There is a definite limit to both of these options for food security and their multiple negative effects on the environment undermine the aim for sustainability. Presently the impact of the Green Revolution on crop production is levelling off at high yields attained and even the potential of large scale irrigation programmes and transgenic crops seem to be limited in view of the expected increase in demand for food. Moreover, climate change threatens to affect agricultural production across the globe. Skyfarming represents a promising approach for food production that is largely environment independent and therefore immune to climate change. Optimal growing conditions, shielded from weather extremes and pests are aimed at raising plant production towards the physiological potential. Selecting rice as a pioneer crop for Skyfarming will not only provide a staple for a large part of the global population, but also significantly reduce the greenhouse gas emission caused by paddy cultivation. Multiplication of the benefits could be achieved by stacking production floors vertically. In Skyfarming the crop, with its requirements for optimal growth, development and production, determines the system's design. Accordingly, the initial development must focus on the growing environment, lighting, temperature, humidity regulation and plant protection strategies as well as on the overall energy supply. For each of these areas potentially suitable technologies are presented and discussed.

AB  - This study was conducted to predict number and fresh weight of leaves, and total leaf area of a single-stemmed rose 'Vital' based on the accumulated thermal units, and to develop a model of shoot development for the prediction of the time when the flowering shoot reaches a phenological stage in a plant factory system. The base temperature (T-b), optimum temperature (T-opt), and maximum temperature (T-max) were estimated by regressing the rate of shoot development against the temperature gradient. The rate of shoot development (R, d(1)) for the phase from cutting to bud break (CT-BB) was best described by a linear model R-b (d(-1)) = -0.0089 + 0.0016.temp. The rate of shoot development for the phase from bud break to harvest (BB-HV) was fitted to the parabolic model R-h (d(-1)) = -0.0001.temp(2) + 0.0054.temp - 0.0484. The T-b, T-opt, and T-max values were 5.56, 27.0, and 42.7 degrees C, respectively. The T-b value was used in the thermal unit computations for the shoot development. Number of leaves, leaf area (LA), and leaf fresh weight showed sigmoidal curves regardless of the cut time. The shoot development and leaf area model was described as a sigmoidal function using thermal units. Leaf area was described as LA = 578.7 [1 + (thermal units/956.1)(-8.54)](-1). Estimated and observed shoot length and leaf fresh weight showed a reasonably good fit with 1.060 (R-2 = 0.976***) and 1.043 (R-2 = 0.955***), respectively. The average thermal units required from cutting to transplant and from transplant to harvest stages were 426 +/- 42 degrees C.d and 783 +/- 24 degrees C.d, respectively.

AB  - A transgenic tomato line (56B, "Moneymaker") that expresses the miraculin gene driven by the CaMV 35S promoter was crossed with a dwarf tomato ("Micro-Tom") for the molecular breeding of cultivars that are suitable for miraculin production in a closed cultivation system. Plant size, miraculin accumulation, and self-pruning growth were used as selection indicators for F-2 plants. Two lines were chosen for further analysis, bred to the F-6 or F-7 generation and cultivated in a closed cultivation system. In 56B and the two crossed lines, the concentrations of miraculin in the pericarp were 140, 367, and 343 mu g/g FW, respectively. We also estimated that 26.2, 73.6, and 45.9 kg FW/m(2) of tomatoes and 2.2, 16.6, and 9.8 mg/m(2) of miraculin in the pericarp, respectively, could be harvested per year. These two crossed lines will be useful for the mass production of miraculin, especially in a closed cultivation system.

AB  - Plant bioelectric potential changes according to environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, light intensity, and atmospheric pressure. Light is the fundamental factor for plant photosynthesis. In this paper, the relationship between bioelectric potential and the wavelength of emitted light (light-emitting diodes (LEDs): blue, green, red, and white) was examined. The bioelectric potential in darkness was adopted as a control and it was compared with those at various wavelengths. The bioelectric potential was measured as a function of time. Data were recorded every 0.1 s and summed over 1 h. The summation value was adopted as a representative value. The correlation between the bioelectric potential under light emission and that of the control was determined. The correlation coefficient reached a maximum as the bioelectric potential under emission was shifted from 1-3 h of light exposure. The coefficient became lower as the wavelength of emitted light became higher. A coefficient of 0.84 under red light (660 nm) at a shifted time of 3 h was obtained, and 0.7 for green light (525 nm) at a shifted time of 1 h, 0.5 for blue (475 nm) without a shift. A coefficient of over 0.5 was obtained under white light at a shifted time of 1-2 h. The obtained result contributes to our understanding of plant physiology. In addition, it contributes to the development of a plant environmental sensor and a plant factory.

AB  - Elevated levels of ethylene occur in controlled environment agriculture and in spaceflight environments, leading to adverse plant growth and sterility. The objectives of this research were to characterize the influence of ethylene on carbon dioxide (CO2) assimilation (C-A), dark period respiration (DPR) and growth of lettuce (Lactuca sativa L. cv. Buttercrunch) under ambient and low total pressure conditions. Lettuce plants were grown under variable total gas pressures of 25 kPa (hypobaric) and 101 kPa (ambient) pressure. Endogenously produced ethylene accumulated and reduced C-A, DPR and plant growth of ambient and hypobaric plants. There was a negative linear correlation between increasing ethylene concentrations [from 0 to around 1000 nmol mol(-1) (ppb)] on C-A, DPR and growth of ambient and hypobaric plants. Declines in C-A and DPR occurred with both exogenous and endogenous ethylene treatments. C-A was more sensitive to increasing ethylene concentration than DPR. There was a direct, negative effect of increasing ethylene concentration reducing gas exchange as well as an indirect ethylene effect on leaf epinasty, which reduced light capture and C-A. While the C-A was comparable, there was a lower DPR in hypobaric than ambient pressure plants - independent of ethylene and under non-limiting CO2 levels (100 Pa pCO(2), nearly three-fold that in normal air). This research shows that lettuce can be grown under hypobaria (congruent to 25% of normal earth ambient total pressure); however, hypobaria caused no significant reduction of endogenous ethylene production.

AB  - Energy conservation in controlled-environment agriculture is a major concern for both commercial and research facilities as well as extraterrestrial facilities for food production. Supplying optimal irradiance by using electrical lighting for the greatest edible biomass production potentially is the greatest draw on energy during earth-based or extraterrestrial food production in controlled environments. Our objective vas to determine the optimal irradiance for greatest edible biomass production of three cultivars of basil (Basilicum ocimum L.) in a controlled-environment production system. Seedlings of the three cultivars were transplanted into soilless medium, one plant per pot, and grew for 17 days in reach-in growth chambers maintained at 25 +/- 4 degrees C with a 16-h photoperiod. Canopy-level irradiances of 300, 400, 500, and 600 mu mol-m(-2).s(-1) were provided by cool-white fluorescent and incandescent lamps. Shoot growth was measured as height, diameter, and number of leaves 0.5 cm long or greater; and edible biomass was measured as leaf fresh weight, shoot fresh weight, and shoot dry weight. There was no irradiance x cultivar interaction, but main effects of irradiance and cultivar were observed. Plant growth and edible biomass production were least at 300 mu mol.m(-2)-s(-1) and greatest at 500 or 600 mu mol-m(-2).s(-1). in several cases, 400 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1) yielded intermediate growth or edible biomass. Within the main effect of cultivar, Italian Large Leaf produced greater edible biomass than 'Genovese', and 'Nufar' yielded an intermediate amount of shoot fresh weight and dry weight. Under our environmental conditions that included ambient CO2 concentration and ambient relative humidity, the rate of growth peaked at 500 mu mol-m(-2).s(-1), and no additional accumulation of edible biomass occurred at 600 mu mol-m(-2).s(-1). Based on our results, canopy-level irradiance of 500 mu mol-m(-2).s(-1) provides maximum edible biomass production of basil in a controlled-environment production system.

AB  - Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have tremendous potential as supplemental or sole-source lighting systems for crop production both on and off earth. Their small size, durability, long operating lifetime, wavelength specificity, relatively cool emitting surfaces, and linear photon output with electrical input current make these solid-state light sources ideal for use in plant lighting designs. Because the output waveband of LEDs (single color, nonphosphor-coated) is much narrower than that of traditional sources of electric lighting used for plant growth, one challenge in designing an optimum plant lighting system is to determine wavelengths essential for specific crops. Work at NASA's Kennedy Space Center has focused on the proportion of blue light required for normal plant growth as well as the optimum wavelength of red and the red/far-red ratio. The addition of green wavelengths for improved plant growth as well as for visual monitoring of plant status has been addressed. Like with other light sources, spectral quality of LEDs can have dramatic effects on crop anatomy and morphology as well as nutrient uptake and pathogen development. Work at Purdue University has focused on geometry of light delivery to improve energy use efficiency of a crop lighting system. Additionally, foliar intumescence developing in the absence of ultraviolet light or other less understood stimuli could become a serious limitation for some crops lighted solely by narrow-band LEDs. Ways to prevent this condition are being investigated. Potential LED benefits to the controlled environment agriculture industry are numerous and more work needs to be done to position horticulture at the forefront of this promising technology.

AB  - The life history parameters were studied for a western isolate of Bactericera cockerelli (Sulc) from a southern Arizona commercial tomato greenhouse (AZ - 06) during 2006. Life history parameters were determined at 26 - 27 C and 60 - 70% humidity, with a 12: 12 day/night cycle. The mean pre-mating period was 4.2 days, with a range of 3.8 - 5 days, and the mean pre-oviposition period was 6.9, with a range of 5.9 - 8.0 days. The mean incubation period for the egg stage was 6.7 days (range 5.7 - 8.2 days), with a nymphal period of 21.9 (19.1 - 23.8 days). The total developmental period was 25 to 33 days, with an average of 28.4 days. The survival of eggs, nymphal stage and total (all stages) survival was 62.7, 47.3 and 40.6%, respectively. The complete life cycle at 26 - 27 C required 34.7 days, ranging from 29.9 to 37 days. Female's fecundity was 231.8 eggs per female, with a range of 184. The longevity for single females and males when reared separately from one another was 48.7 and 22.0 days. In contrast, when males and females were reared together on the same leaf they lived for the same number of days (41.5 days), irrespective of sex. It is not clear if the discrepancies noted here in life history traits are due to genetically inherited differences among different psyllid isolates, as they could as readily be modulated by environment and/or even their histories of host plant association. Also, an additional possibility by which differences in fitness observed herein, compared to psyllid isolates studied previously (for which no voucher specimens are available), might be due to infection by some prokaryotes like Wolbachia, which already reported in literature that might influenced host fitness, e. g. fecundity and longevity.

AB  - Artificial lighting is a merit of a 'plant factory', which might be utilized to suppress an increase in pest population. We investigated the effects of extending the light phase on diapause induction in the two-spotted spider mite (TSSM), Tetranychus urticae. TSSM were reared at 18 degrees C under light phases ranging from 2 to 64 h combined with a constant dark phase of 16 h in aluminum bottles, with white light emitting diodes attached inside to minimize fluctuations in air temperature between the light and dark phases. Diapause was induced in adult TSSM females when the light phase was 24 h or shorter, and diapause induction was inhibited when the light phase extended over 32 h. The development of deutonymphs was delayed under a diapause-inducing photoperiod. Diapause inducing photoperiods may suppress an increase in the TSSM population, by slowing down development and reproduction.

AB  - Plants produce various phytochemicals that are of nutritional and medicinal value to humans. Phytochemicals having antioxidant capacity are drawing increased interest from consumers. Population studies among Americans have consistently demonstrated inadequate consumption of fruit and vegetables. Improving intake of fruit and vegetables has been a major public health effort for many years with minimal success. Given this, it seems opportunistic to consider other approaches to enhance the nutritional quality of the American diet. One plausible approach is the development of fresh produce containing a greater concentration of phytochemicals known to improve health, thus while consuming fewer servings of produce, Americans would still have significant exposure to health-promoting food constituents. Controlled environments provide a unique opportunity to modify the concentrations of selected phytochemicals in fruit and vegetables, yet practical information is limited regarding methods effective in optimizing antioxidant capacity. Our research at the University of Arizona Controlled Environment Agriculture Program has shown that application of moderate salt stress to tomato plants can enhance lycopene and potentially other antioxidant concentrations in fruit. The increase in lycopene in response to salt stress in the tomato fruit was shown to be cultivar specific, varying from 34% to 85%. Although the specific biological mechanisms involved in increasing fruit lycopene deposition has not been clearly elucidated, evidence suggests that increasing antioxidant concentrations is a primary physiological response of the plant to the salt stress. Another experiment showed that low temperature during postharvest increased antioxidant capacity of tomato fruit while it maintained the lycopene concentration. More detailed study in this area is needed including. accumulation of antioxidant phytochemicals as affected by environmental conditions during the cultivation and the postharvest.

AB  - A qualitative systems approach to controlled environment agriculture (CEA) is presented by means of several multi-institutional projects integrated into a demonstration greenhouse at the Burlington County Resource Recovery Complex (BCRRC), N.J. The greenhouse has about 0.4 ha of production space, and is located about 800 In from the about 40-ha BCRRC landfill site. A portion of the landfill gas produced from the BCRRC site is used for microturbine electricity generation and for heating the greenhouse. The waste heat from the turbines, which are roughly 15 m from the greenhouse, is used as the main heat source for the greenhouse in the winter months, and to desalinate water when heating is not required. Recovery of this waste heat increases the energy efficiency of the four 30-kW turbines from about 25% to 75%. Within the greenhouse, aquaculture and hydroponic crop production are coupled by recycling the aquaculture effluent as a nutrient source for the plants. Both the sludge resulting from the filtered effluent and the inedible biomass from harvested plants are vermicomposted (i.e., rather than being sent to the landfill), resulting in marketable products such as soil amendments and liquid plant fertilizer. If suitably cleaned of contaminants, the CO2 from the landfill gas may be used to enrich the plant growing area within the greenhouse to increase the yield of the edible products. Landfill gas from the BCRRC site has successfully been processed to recover liquid commercial grade CO2 and contaminant-free methane-CO2, with the potential for this gas mixture to be applied as a feedstock for fuel cells or for methanol production. Carbon dioxide from the turbine exhaust may also be recovered for greenhouse enrichment. Alternatively, algal culture may be used to assimilate CO2 from the turbine exhaust into biomass, which may then be used as a biofuel, or possibly as fish feed, thus making the system more self-contained. By recycling energy and materials, the system described would displace fossil fuel use, mitigating negative environmental impacts such as greenhouse gas emissions, and generate less waste in need of disposal. Successful implementation of the coupled landfill (gas-to-energy . aquaponic . desalination) system would particularly benefit developing regions, such as those of the Greater Caribbean Basin.

KW  - LIGHT
AB  - One of the deterrents to the commercial adoption of controlled-environment agriculture (CEA) on a broad scale is the significant energy cost for lighting and thermal environmental control. Advances in energy conversion technologies, such as internal combustion engines (ICs), microturbines and fuel cells, offer the potential for combined heat and power (CHP) systems, which can be matched with the needs of CEA to reduce fossil-based fuels consumption. A principal concept delineated is that an integrated entrepreneurial approach to create business and community partnerships can enhance the value of energy produced (both electrical and heat). Energy production data from a commercial dairy farm is contrasted with energy use data from two greenhouse operations with varying energy-input requirements. Biogass produced from a 500-cow dairy combined with a 250-kW fuel cell could meet nearly all of the energy needs of both the dairy and an energy-intensive 740-m(2) CEA greenhouse lettuce facility. The data suggest CEA greenhouses and other closely compatible enterprises can be developed to significantly alter agriculture, as we have known it.

AB  - Since high concentration levels of nitrate in lettuce and other leafy vegetables are undesirable, cultivation of lettuce according to specified governmental regulations is currently an important issue. Therefore, methods are sought in order to produce a lettuce crop that allow maximization of the profits of the grower while at the same time insuring the quality of the crops. Using a two-state dynamic lettuce model that predicts the amount of nitrate at harvest time, an optimal control problem with terminal constraints is formulated. The situation considered may be relevant in a plant factory where a fixed head weight should be reached in fixed time while minimizing light input. First, optimal trajectories of light, CO2 and temperature are calculated using the adjustable control weight (ACW) gradient method. Subsequently, novel, efficient and modified differential evolution (DE) algorithms are used to obtain an approximate solution to the same optimal control problem. While the gradient method yields a more accurate result, the optimum may be local. In order to exploit the salient characteristics of a DE algorithm as a global direct search method, a hybrid-combined approach is proposed. An approximate solution obtained with a DE algorithm is used to initialize the ACW gradient method. Although local minima did not seem to occur in this particular case, the results show the feasibility of this approach. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - A previously developed dynamic growth simulation model for cut tulip production in a plant factory system which predicts forcing period and flower quality of cut tulips from duration of bulb chilling and forcing temperature was confirmed.
   In a 1993 - 1994 experiment in which bulbs were forced at 20 degreesC, irrespective of the duration of their chilling period at 2 degreesC, the simulated values of number of days from planting to anthesis, shoot (cut flower) fresh weight, perianth length and dry weight of the component parts at anthesis correlated well with the observed values. In a 1998 - 1999 experiment in which the forcing temperature was lowered with the extension of the duration of bulb chilling at 2 degreesC, when the duration of bulb chilling was extended to 26 weeks or longer, shoot fresh weight, perianth length and dry weights of shoot and floral organs at anthesis were underestimated by the model, while the dry weight of daughter bulbs was overestimated. These differences were supposed to be caused by fluctuation in bulb properties and could be diminished by inputting the dry weights of the mother bulb and daughter bulbs at planting into the model.

AB  - A dynamic simulation model applicable to the production of cut tulips in a plant factory was developed. This model can predict the forcing days and the cut flower quality from the period of bulb chilling at 2 degreesC and the forcing temperatures. Data for calibration were collected from the hydroponic forcing experiments in 1996 and 1997 using 'Gander', in which the period of bulb chilling at 2 degreesC and the forcing temperatures were varied. In the model, translocation of dry matter from the mother bulb scales to newly developing component parts, i.e., shoot, floral organs, and daughter bulbs was simulated via the effects of the periods of bulb chilling and the forcing temperatures on dry weights at planting and relative growth rates of component parts, and days from planting to anthesis. Shoot fresh weight and perianth length were calculated from shoot dry and perianth dry weights, respectively. The agreement in verification between the simulated days from planting to anthesis, shoot fresh weight and perianth length and those observed in the forcing experiment was favorable.

AB  - A crop growth model is used to investigate the optimal control problem associated with plant factory operation. The aim is to find the optimal age-dependent spacing between individual plants such that the profit of the farmer is maximized, in a situation when the production is quota limited. It is shown that the optimal spacing is such that the crop density is kept constant, corresponding to a constant value of the co-state variable in the associated optimal control problem.

AB  - The overall design of an industrial crop production system should optimize the system's global parameters, such as total area required, intensity of cultivation and general production schedule. The key element is the optimal intensity of cultivation for the prevailing climatic and economic environments. A single-state-variable vegetative crop model (e.g. lettuce) was used to optimize a crop production system for two economic environments: quota- and area-limited production. A strictly uniform weather (every hour of the season) was assumed initially. Continuous spacing was a central control element. The main conclusions of the analysis with our model are: (1) plants of all ages can grow together in a single climatic compartment; (2) spacing should be scheduled to maintain a constant canopy density; (3) optimal canopy density is an increasing function of available light and a decreasing function of temperature; (4) where produce-price is high relative to the prices of rent and energy, the optimal cultivation intensity for an area-limited operation is higher than for a quota-limited operation; the opposite is true where rent is expensive; and (5) the marginal price to be paid for supplementary light is smaller where available natural light is more plentiful.

As a result, we confirmed the high effectiveness of high pressure sodium lamps for plant growth within the PAR range of wavelengths, and concluded that a metal halide lamp 3,500 K(150 W high color rendering index type) was a suitable light source for indoor maintenance of ornamental plants. We also analyzed the light quality balance within the PAR range of different artificial light sources, by using the R/B and R/FR ratios as a reference to photomorphogenesis.

AB  - Biotronics has been involved, under NASA sponsorship, in a wide ranging research and development program for instrumentation used in the monitoring and control of controlled environment agriculture. This program has embraced both chemical monitoring of plant nutrient solutions as well as microbiological monitoring of bacteria and fungi in these same solutions. This paper emphasizes the microbiological monitoring aspects of this program. In contrast to traditional methods of microbiological analysis based on culturing, staining and microscopic observation, the development described here is based on spectroscopic measurements, more specifically spectral fluorometry. The rationale, objectives, analytical methods and new instrumentation employed in the development of an on-line microbiological analyzer (MBA) are presented in some detail. Finally, the signal processing/pattern recognition methods used to evaluate the spectral data and produce estimates of microbial populations are described along with experimental test results to conclude the paper.

AB  - In a plant factory, optimal control for obtaining higher yield and better quality of plants is essential. A modern control technique using optimal regulators and an intelligent control technique using genetic algorithms were applied to the control of the physiological processes of plants. In modern control, the variation in diameter with light intensity was measured, and the ARMA model was identified using the least squares method. Optimal regulators with a Kalman tilter were used to control the water status of plants. In the intelligent control, on the other hand, the neural network was used for the model identification of net photosynthetic rate as affected by intermittent drainage of a hydroponic solution, and then the genetic algorithm was used for optimization via model simulation. These control techniques were quite useful for the optimal control of the physiological processes of plants.
